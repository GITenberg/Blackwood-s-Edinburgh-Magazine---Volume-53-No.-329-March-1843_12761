<h3>A TRUE TALE OF THE CAUCASUS.</h3>

<p>TRANSLATED FROM THE RUSSIAN OF MARL&Iacute;NSKI. BY THOMAS B. SHAW, B.A.
OF CAMBRIDGE, ADJUNCT PROFESSOR OF ENGLISH LITERATURE IN THE IMPERIAL
LYCEUM OF TSARSKO&Euml; SELO.</p>

<h3>THE TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.</h3>

<p>The English mania for travelling, which supplies our continental neighbours
with such abundant matter for wonderment and witticism, is of no very
recent date. Now more than ever, perhaps, does this passion seem to possess
us:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>&quot;&mdash;&mdash;tenet insanabile multos</p>
<p><i>Terrarum</i> <span lang="EL" title="kakoithes">&kappa;&alpha;&kappa;&omicron;&eta;&theta;&epsilon;&sigmaf;</span>, et &aelig;gro in corde senescit:&quot;</p>
</div></div>

<p>when the press groans with &quot;Tours,&quot; &quot;Trips,&quot; &quot;Hand-books,&quot; &quot;Journeys,&quot;
&quot;Visits.&quot;</p>

<p>In spite of this, it is as notorious as unaccountable, that England knows
very little, or at least very little correctly, of the social condition, manners,
and literature of one of the most powerful among her continental sisters.</p>

<p>The friendly relations between Great Britain and Russia, established in the
reign of Edward V., have subsisted without interruption since that epoch, so
auspicious to both nations: the bond of amity, first knit by Chancellor in 1554,
has never since been relaxed: the two nations have advanced, each at its own
pace, and by its own paths, towards the sublime goal of improvement and
civilization&mdash;have stood shoulder to shoulder in the battle for the weal and
liberty of mankind.</p>

<p>It is, nevertheless, as strange as true, that the land of Alfred and Elizabeth
is yet but imperfectly acquainted with the country of Peter and of Catharine.
The cause of this ignorance is assuredly not to be found in any indifference
or want of curiosity on the part of English travellers. There is no lack of
pilgrims annually leaving the bank of Thames,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>&quot;With cockle hat and staff,</p>
<p class="i2">With gourd and sandal shoon;&quot;</p>
</div></div>

<p>armed duly with note-book and &quot;patent Mordan,&quot; directing their wandering
steps to the shores of Ingria, or the gilded cupolas of Moscow. But a very
<a class="pagenum" name="page282" id="page282" title="page282"></a>short residence in the empire of the Tsar will suffice to convince a foreigner
how defective, and often how false, is the information given by travellers respecting
the social and national character of the Russians. These abundant
and singular misrepresentations are not, of course, voluntary; and it may not
be useless to point out their principal sources.</p>

<p>The chief of these is, without doubt, the difficulty and novelty of the language,
and the unfortunate facility of travelling over the beaten track&mdash;from
St Petersburg to Moscow, and from Moscow, perhaps, to Nijny N&oacute;vgorod, without
any acquaintance with that language. The foreigner may enjoy, during a
visit of the usual duration, the hospitality for which the higher classes are so
justly celebrated; but his association with the nobility will be found an absolute
obstacle to the making even a trifling progress in the Russian language;
which, though now regaining a degree of attention from the elevated
classes,<a name="footnotetag1" id="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>
too long denied to it by those with whom their native tongue <i>was</i> an unfashionable
one&mdash;he would have no occasion at all to speak, and not even very
frequent opportunities of hearing.</p>

<p>But even in those rare cases where the stranger united to a determination
to study the noble and interesting language of the country, an intention of
remaining here long enough to learn it, he was often discouraged by the belief,
that the literature was too poor to repay his time and labour. Besides,
the Russian language has so little relation to the other European tongues&mdash;it
stands so much alone, and throws so little direct light upon any of them, that
another obstacle was thrown into his way.</p>

<p>The acquisition of any one of that great family of languages, all derived,
more or less remotely, from the Latin, which extends over the whole south
and west of Europe, cannot fail to cast a strong light upon the other cognate
dialects; as the knowledge of any one of the Oriental tongues facilitates,
nay almost confers, a mastery over the thousand others, which are less languages
of distinct type than dialects of the same speech, offshoots from the
same stock.</p>

<p>Add to this, the extraordinary errors and omissions which abound in every
disquisition hitherto published in French, English, and German periodicals
with regard to Russian literature, and deform those wretched rags of translation
which are all that has been hitherto done towards the reproduction, in
our own language, of the literature of Russia. These versions were made by
persons utterly unacquainted with the country, the manners, and the people, or
made after the Russian had been distilled through the alembic of a previous
French or German translation.</p>

<p>Poetry naturally forces its way into the notice of a foreign nation sooner
than prose; but it is, nevertheless, rather singular than honourable to the
literary enterprise of England, that the present is the first attempt to introduce
to the British public any work of Russian Prose Fiction whatever, with any
thing like a reasonable selection of subject and character, at least <i>directly</i> from
the original language.</p>

<p>The two volumes of Translations published by Bowring, under the title of
&quot;Russian Anthology,&quot; and consisting chiefly of short lyric pieces, would appear
at first sight an exception to that indifference to the productions of Russian
genius of which we have accused the English public; and the popularity
of that collection would be an additional encouragement to the hope, that our
charge may be, if not ill-founded, at least exaggerated.</p>

<p>We are willing to believe, that the degree&mdash;if we are rightly informed, no
slight one&mdash;of interest with which these volumes were welcomed in England,
was sufficient to blind their readers to the extreme incompetency with which
the translations they contained were executed.</p>

<p>It is always painful to find fault&mdash;more painful to criticise with severity&mdash;the
work of a person whose motive was the same as that which actuates the present
<a class="pagenum" name="page283" id="page283" title="page283"></a>publication; but when the gross unfaithfulness<a
name="footnotetag2" id="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> exhibited in the versions
in question tends to give a false and disparaging idea of the value and the tone
of Russian poetry, we may be excused for our apparent uncourteousness in
thus pointing out their defects.</p>

<p>It will not, we trust, be considered out of place to give our readers a brief
sketch of the history of the Russian literature; the origin, growth, and fortunes
of which are marked by much that is peculiar. In doing this we shall
content ourselves with noting, as briefly as possible, the events which preceded
and accompanied the birth of letters in Russia, and the evolution of a literature
not elaborated by the slow and imperceptible action of time, but bursting,
like the armed Pallas, suddenly into light.</p>

<p>In performing this task, we shall confine our attention solely to the department
of Prose Fiction, looking forward meanwhile with anxiety, though not
without hope, to a future opportunity of discussing more fully the intellectual
annals of Russia.</p>

<p>In the year of redemption 863, two Greeks of Thessalonika, Cyril<a
name="footnotetag3" id="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> and
Methodius, sent by Michael, Emperor of the East, conferred the precious
boon of alphabetic writing upon Kostisl&aacute;ff, Sviatop&oacute;lk, and K&oacute;tsel, then chiefs
of the Moravians.</p>

<p>The characters they introduced were naturally those of the Greek alphabet,
to which they were obliged, in order to represent certain sounds which do not
occur in the Greek language,<a name="footnotetag4" id="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> to add a number of other signs borrowed from
the Hebrew, the Armenian, and the Coptic. So closely, indeed, did this alphabet,
called the Cyrillian, follow the Greek characters, that the use of the
aspirates was retained without any necessity.</p>

<p>These characters (with the exception of a few which are omitted in the Russian)
varied surprisingly little in their form,<a name="footnotetag5" id="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a> and perhaps without any change
whatever in their vocal value, compose the modern alphabet of the Russian language;
an examination of which would go far, in our opinion, to settle the
long agitated question respecting the ancient pronunciation of the classic languages,
particularly as Cyril and his brother adapted the Greek alphabet to a
language totally foreign from, and unconnected with, any dialect of Greek.</p>

<p>In this, as in all other languages, the translation of the Bible is the first
monument and model of literature. This version was made by Cyril immediately
after the composition of the alphabet. The language spoken at Thessalonika
was the Servian: but from the immense number of purely Greek
words which occur in the translation, as well as from the fact of the version
<a class="pagenum" name="page284" id="page284" title="page284"></a>being a strictly literal one, it is probable that the Scriptures were not translated
into any specific spoken dialect at all; but that a kind of <i>mezzo-termine</i>
was selected&mdash;or rather formed&mdash;for the purpose. What we have advanced
derives a still stronger degree of probability from the circumstance, that the
Slavonic Bible follows the Greek <i>construction</i>. This Bible, with slight changes
and corrections produced by three or four revisions made at different periods,
is that still employed by the Russian Church; and the present spoken language
of the country differs so widely from it, that the Slavonian of the
Bible forms a separate branch of education to the priests and to the upper
classes&mdash;who are instructed in this <i>dead</i> language, precisely as an Italian must
study Latin in order to read the Bible.</p>

<p>Above the sterile and uninteresting desert of early Russian history, towers,
like the gigantic Sphynx of Ghizeh over the sand of the Thebaid, one colossal
figure&mdash;that of Vlad&iacute;mir Sviatosl&aacute;vitch; the first to surmount the bloody
splendour of the Great Prince's bonnet<a name="footnotetag6" id="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a> with the mildly-radiant Cross of
Christ.</p>

<p>From the conversion to Christianity of Vlad&iacute;mir and his subjects&mdash;passing
over the wild and rapacious dominion of the Tartar hordes, which lasted for
about 250 years&mdash;we may consider two languages, essentially distinct, to have
been employed in Russia till the end of the 17th century&mdash;the one the written
or learned, the other the spoken language.</p>

<p>The former was the Slavonian into which the Holy Scriptures were translated:
and this remained the learned or official language for a long period.
In this&mdash;or in an imitation of this, effected with various degrees of success&mdash;were
compiled the different collections of Monkish annals which form the
treasury whence future historians were to select their materials from among
the valuable, but confused accumulations of facts; in this the solemn acts of
Government, treaties, codes, &amp;c., were composed; and the few writings which
cannot be comprised under the above classes<a name="footnotetag7" id="footnotetag7"></a><a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a> were naturally compiled in the
language, emphatically that of the Church and of learning.</p>

<p>The sceptre of the wild Tartar Khans was not, as may be imagined, much
allied to the pen; the hordes of fierce and greedy savages which overran,
like the locusts of the Apocalypse, for two centuries and a half the fertile
plains of central and southern Russia, contented themselves with exacting
tribute from a nation which they despised probably too much to feel any desire
of interfering with its language; and the dominion of the Tartars produced
hardly any perceptible effect upon the Russian tongue.<a
name="footnotetag8" id="footnotetag8"></a><a href="#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>It is to the reign of Alex&eacute;i Mikh&aacute;ilovitch, who united Little Russia to
Muscovy, that we must look for the germ of the modern literature of the
country: the language had begun to feel the influence of the Little Russian,
tinctured by the effects of Polish civilization, and the spirit of classicism which
so long distinguished the Sarmatian literature.</p>

<p>The impulse given to this union, of so momentous an import to the future
fortunes of the empire, at the beginning of the year 1654, would possibly have
brought forth in course of time a literature in Russia such as we now find it,
had not the extraordinary reign, and still more extraordinary character, of
Peter the Great interposed certain disturbing&mdash;if, indeed, they may not be called
in some measure impeding&mdash;forces. That giant hand which broke down the
<a class="pagenum" name="page285" id="page285" title="page285"></a>long impregnable dike which had hitherto separated Russia from the rest of
Europe, and admitted the arts, the learning, and the civilization of the West
to rush in with so impetuous a flood, fertilizing as it came, but also destroying
and sweeping away something that was valuable, much that was national&mdash;that
hand was unavoidably too heavy and too strong to nurse the infant seedling
of literature; and the command and example of Peter perhaps rather
favoured the imitation of what was good in other languages, than the production
of originality in his own.</p>

<p>This opinion, bold and perhaps rash as it may appear to Russians, seems to
derive some support, as well as illustration, from the immense number of foreign
words which make the Russian of Peter's time</p>

<div class="blkquot"><p>&quot;A Babylonish dialect;&quot;</p></div>

<p>the mania for every thing foreign having overwhelmed the language with an
infinity of terms rudely torn, not skilfully adapted, from every tongue; terms
which might have been&mdash;have, indeed, since been&mdash;translated into words of
Russian form and origin. A review of the literary progress made at this
time will, we think, go far to establish our proposition; it will exhibit a very
large proportion of translations, but very few original productions.</p>

<p>From this period begins the more immediate object of the present note: we
shall briefly trace the rise and fortunes of the present, or vernacular Russian
literature; confining our attention, as we have proposed, to the Prose Fiction,
and contenting ourselves with noting, cursorily, the principal authors in this
kind, living and dead.</p>

<p>At the time of Peter the Great, there may be said to have existed (it will
be convenient to keep in mind) three languages&mdash;the Slavonic, to which we
have already alluded; the Russian; and the dialect of Little Russia.</p>

<p>The fact, that the learned are not yet agreed upon the exact epoch from
which to date the origin of the modern Russian literature, will probably raise
a smile on the reader's lip; but the difficulty of establishing this important
starting-point will become apparent when he reflects upon the circumstance,
that the literature is&mdash;as we have stated&mdash;divisible into two distinct and widely
differing regions. It will be sufficiently accurate to date the origin of the
modern Russian literature at about a century back from the present time;
and to consider Lomon&oacute;soff as its founder. Mikh&aacute;il Vass&iacute;lievitch Lomon&oacute;soff,
born in 1711, is the author who may with justice be regarded as the
Chaucer or the Boccacio of the North: a man of immense and varied accomplishments,
distinguished in almost every department of literature, and in many
of the walks of science. An orator and a poet, he adorned the language whose
principles he had fixed as a grammarian.</p>

<p>He was the first to write in the spoken language of his country, and, in
conjunction with his two contemporaries, Soumar&oacute;koff and Kher&aacute;skoff, he laid
the foundations of the Russian literature.</p>

<p>Of the other two names we have mentioned as entitled to share the reverence
due from every Russian to the fathers of his country's letters, it will be
sufficient to remark, that Soumar&oacute;koff was the first to introduce tragedy and
opera, and Kher&aacute;skoff, the author of two epic poems which we omit to particularize,
as not coming within our present scope, wrote a work entitled
&quot;Cadmus and Harmonia,&quot; which may be considered as the first romance.
It is a narrative and metaphysical work, which we should class as a &quot;prose
poem;&quot; the style being considerably elevated above the tone of the &quot;Musa
pedestris.&quot;</p>

<p>The name of Em&iacute;n comes next in historical, though not literary, importance:
though the greater part of his productions consists of translations, particularly
of those shorter pieces of prose fiction called by the Italians &quot;novelle,&quot;
he was the author of a few original pieces, now but little read; his
style bears the marks, like that of Kher&aacute;skoff, of heaviness, stiffness, and want
of finish.</p>

<p>The reputation of Karamz&iacute;n is too widely spread throughout Europe to
render necessary more than a passing remark as to the additions made by him
to the literature of his country in the department of fiction: he commenced
a romance, of which he only lived to finish a few of the first chapters.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page286" id="page286" title="page286"></a>Nar&eacute;jniy was the first to paint the real life of Russia&mdash;or rather of the South
or Little Russia: in his works there is a good deal of vivacity, but as they are
deformed by defects both in style and taste, his reputation has become almost
extinct. We cannot quit this division of our subject, which refers to romantic
fiction anterior to the appearance of the regular historical novel, without mentioning
the names of two, among a considerable number of authors, distinguished
as having produced short narratives or tales, embodying some historical
event&mdash;Polev&oacute;i and Best&oacute;njeff&mdash;the latter of whom wrote, under the
name of Marl&iacute;nski, a very large number of tales, which have acquired a high
and deserved reputation.</p>

<p>It is with Zag&oacute;skin that we may regard the regular historical novel&mdash;viewing
that species of composition as exemplified in the works of Scott&mdash;as having
commenced.</p>

<p>With reference to the present state of romance in Russia, the field is so
extensive as to render impossible, in this place, more than a cursory allusion
to the principal authors and their best-known works: in doing which, we shall
attend more exclusively to those productions of which the subject or treatment
is purely national.</p>

<p>One of the most popular and prolific writers of fiction is Zag&oacute;skin, whose
historical romance &quot;Yo&uacute;riy Milosl&aacute;ffskiy,&quot; met with great and permanent
success. The epoch of this story is in 1612, a most interesting crisis in the
Russian history, when the valour of M&iacute;nin enabled his countrymen to shake
off the hated yoke of Poland. His other work, &quot;Roslavle&oacute;ff,&quot; is less interesting:
the period is 1812. We may also mention his &quot;Iskons&iacute;tel&quot;&mdash;&quot;the
Tempter&quot;&mdash;a fantastic story, in which an imaginary being is represented as
mingling with and influencing the affairs of real life.</p>

<p>Of Boulg&aacute;rin, we may mention, besides his &quot;Ivan Vu&iacute;jgin,&quot; a romance in the
manner of &quot;Gil Blas,&quot; the scenery and characters of which are entirely Russian,
two historical novels of considerable importance. &quot;The False Dim&iacute;tri,&quot; and
&quot;Mazeppa,&quot;&mdash;the hero of the latter being <i>a real person</i>, and not, as most
readers are aware, a fictitious character invented by Byron.</p>

<p>Next comes the name of Laj&eacute;tchnikoff, whose &quot;Last Page&quot; possesses a
reputation, we believe, tolerably extensive throughout Europe. The action
passes during the war between Charles XII. and Peter the Great, and Catharine
plays a chief part in it, as servant of the pastor Gl&uuml;ck, becoming empress
at the conclusion. The &quot;House of Ice,&quot; by the same writer, is perhaps
more generally known than the preceding work. The last-named romance
depicts with great spirit the struggle between the Russian and foreign parties
in the reign of Anna Iv&aacute;novna. But perhaps the most remarkable work of
Laj&eacute;tchnikoff is the romance entitled &quot;Bassourm&aacute;n,&quot; the scene of which is
laid under Iv&aacute;n III., surnamed the Great.<a name="footnotetag9"
id="footnotetag9"></a><a href="#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a> Another Polev&oacute;i (Nikol&aacute;i) produced
a work of great merit:&mdash;&quot;The Oath at the Tomb of Our Lord,&quot; a very
faithful picture of the first half of the fifteenth century, and singular from the
circumstance that love plays no part in the drama. Besides this, we owe to
Polev&oacute;i a wild story entitled &quot;Abbaddon.&quot; Veltman produced, under the
title of &quot;Kostsh&eacute;i the Deathless,&quot; a historical study of the manners of the
twelfth century, possessing considerable merit. It would be unjust to omit
the name of a lady, the Countess Sh&iacute;shkin, who produced the historical novel
&quot;Mikh&aacute;il Vass&iacute;lievitch Sk&oacute;pin-Sh&uacute;isky,&quot; which obtained great popularity.</p>

<p>The picturesque career of Lomon&oacute;soff gave materials for a romantic biography
of that poet, the work of Xenoph&oacute;nt Polev&oacute;i, resembling, in its mixture
of truth and fiction, the &quot;Wahrheit und Dichtung&quot; of Goethe.</p>

<p>Among the considerable number of romances already mentioned, those exhibiting
scenes of private life and domestic interest have not been neglected.
Kal&aacute;shnikoff wrote &quot;The Merchant J&aacute;loboff's Daughter,&quot; and the &quot;Kamtchad&aacute;lka,&quot;
<a class="pagenum" name="page287" id="page287" title="page287"></a>both describing the scenery and manners of Siberia; the former
painting various parts of that wild and interesting country, the latter confined
more particularly to the Peninsula of Kamtch&aacute;tka. Besides G&oacute;gol, whose
easy and prolific pen has presented us with so many humorous sketches of
provincial life, we cannot pass over Begitch&eacute;ff, whose &quot;Kh&oacute;lmsky Family&quot;
possesses much interest; but the delineations of G&oacute;gol depend so much for
their effect upon delicate shades of manner, &amp;c., that it is not probable they
can ever be effectively reproduced in another language.</p>

<p>Mentioning Per&oacute;ffsky, whose &quot;Monast&iacute;rka&quot; gives a picture of Russian
interior life, we pass to Gretch, an author of some European reputation.
His &quot;Trip to Germany&quot; describes, with singular piquancy, the manners of
a very curious race&mdash;the Germans of St Petersburg; and &quot;Tch&eacute;rnaia J&eacute;nstchina,&quot;
&quot;the Black Woman,&quot; presents a picture of Russian society, which
was welcomed with great eagerness by the public.</p>

<p>The object of these pages being to invite the attention of British readers to
a very rich field, in a literature hitherto most unaccountably neglected by the
English public, the present would not be a fit occasion to enter with any
minuteness into the history of Russian letters, or to give, in fact, more than a
passing allusion to its chief features; the translator hopes that he will be excused
for the meagreness of the present notice.</p>

<p>He will be abundantly repaid for his exertions, by the discovery of any increasing
desire on the part of his countrymen to become more accurately
acquainted with the character of a nation, worthy, he is convinced, of a very
high degree of respect and admiration. How could that acquaintance be so
delightfully, or so effectually made, as by the interchange of literature? The
great works of English genius are read, studied, and admired, throughout the
vast empire of Russia; the language of England is rapidly and steadily extending,
and justice, no less than policy, demands, that many absurd misapprehensions
respecting the social and domestic character, no less than the
history, of Russia, should be dispelled by truth.</p>

<p>The translator, in conclusion, trusts that it will not be superfluous to specify
one or two of the reasons which induced him to select the present romance,
as the first-fruit of his attempt to naturalize in England the literature
of Russia.</p>

<p>It is considered as a very good specimen of the author's style; the facts and
characters are all strictly true;<a name="footnotetag10" id="footnotetag10"></a><a href="#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a> besides this, the author passed many years
in the Caucasus, and made full use of the opportunities he thus enjoyed of becoming
familiar with the language, manners, and scenery of a region on
which the attention of the English public has long been turned with peculiar
interest.</p>

<p>The picturesqueness as well as the fidelity of his description will, it is
hoped, secure for the tale a favourable reception with a public always
&quot;<i>novitatis avida</i>,&quot; and whose appetite, now somewhat palled with the &quot;Bismillahs&quot;
and &quot;Mashallahs&quot; of the ordinary oriental novels, may find some
piquancy in a new variety of Mahomedan life&mdash;that of the Caucasian Tartars.</p>

<p>The Russian language possessing many characters and some few sounds for
which there is no exact equivalent in English, we beg to say a word upon the
method adopted on the present occasion so to represent the Russian orthography,
as to avoid the shocking barbarisms of such combinations as <i>zh</i>, &amp;c.
&amp;c., and to secure, at the same time, an approach to the correct pronunciation.
<a class="pagenum" name="page288" id="page288" title="page288"></a>Throughout these pages the vowels <i>a, e, i, o, y</i>, are supposed to be pronounced
as in French, the diphthong <i>ou</i> as in the word <i>you</i>, the <i>j</i> always with
the French sound.</p>

<p>With respect to the combinations of consonants employed, <i>kh</i> has the gutteral
sound of the <i>ch</i> in the Scottish word <i>loch</i>, and <i>gh</i> is like a rather rough
or coarse aspirate.</p>

<p>The simple <i>g</i> is invariably to be uttered hard, as in <i>gun</i> or <i>gall</i>.</p>

<p>To avoid the possibility of errors, the combination <i>tch</i>, though not a very
soft one to the eye, represents a Russian sound for which there is no character
in English. It is, of course, uttered as in the word <i>watch</i>.</p>

<p>As a great deal of the apparent discord of Russian words, as pronounced by
foreigners, arises from ignorance of the place of the accent, we have added a
sign over every polysyllable word, indicating the part on which the stress is
to be laid.</p>

<p>The few preceding rules will, the translator hopes, enable his countrymen
to <i>attack</i> the pronunciation of the Russian names without the ancient dread
inspired by terrific and complicated clusters of consonants; and will perhaps
prove to them that the language is both an easy and a melodious one.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>


<div class="blkquot">
<p>&quot;Be slow to offend&mdash;swift to revenge!&quot;</p>
<p><i>Inscription on a dagger of Daghest&aacute;n.</i></p>
</div>

<p>It was Djoum&aacute;.<a name="footnotetag11" id="footnotetag11"></a><a href="#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a> Not far from
Bouin&aacute;ki, a considerable village of
Northern Daghest&aacute;n, the young Tartars
were assembled for their national
exercise called &quot;djig&iacute;tering;&quot; that is,
the horse-race accompanied by various
trials of boldness and strength. Bouin&aacute;ki
is situated upon two ledges of
the precipitous rocks of the mountain:
on the left of the road leading from
Derbend to Tarki, rises, soaring above
the town, the crest of Caucasus, feathered
with wood; on the right, the
shore, sinking imperceptibly, spreads
itself out into meadows, on which the
Caspian Sea pours its eternal murmur,
like the voice of human multitudes.</p>

<p>A vernal day was fading into evening,
and all the inhabitants, attracted
rather by the coolness of the breeze
than by any feeling of curiosity, had
quitted their s&aacute;klas,<a name="footnotetag12" id="footnotetag12"></a><a href="#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a> and assembled
in crowds on both sides of the road.
The women, without veils, and with
coloured kerchiefs rolled like turbans
round their heads, clad in the long
chemise,<a name="footnotetag13" id="footnotetag13"></a><a href="#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a> confined by the short arkhalo&uacute;kh,
and wide toum&aacute;ns,<a name="footnotetag14" id="footnotetag14"></a><a href="#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a> sat in
rows, while strings of children sported
before them. The men, assembled in
little groups, stood, or rested on their
knees;<a name="footnotetag15" id="footnotetag15"></a><a href="#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a> others, in twos or threes,
walked slowly round, smoking tobacco
in little wooden pipes: a cheerful
buzz arose, and ever and anon resounded
the clattering of hoofs, and
the cry &quot;katch, katch!&quot; (make way!)
from the horsemen preparing for the
race.</p>

<p>Nature, in Daghest&aacute;n, is most
lovely in the month of May. Millions
of roses poured their blushes over the
<a class="pagenum" name="page289" id="page289" title="page289"></a>crags; their odour was streaming in
the air; the nightingale was not silent
in the green twilight of the wood, almond-trees,
all silvered with their
flowers, arose like the cupolas of a
pagoda, and resembled, with their
lofty branches twined with leaves,
the minarets of some Mussulman
mosque. Broad-breasted oaks, like
sturdy old warriors, rose here and
there, while poplars and chenart-trees,
assembled in groups and surrounded
by underwood, looked like children
ready to wander away to the mountains,
to escape the summer heats.
Sportive flocks of sheep&mdash;their fleeces
speckled with rose-colour; buffaloes
wallowing in the mud of the fountains,
or for hours together lazily butting
each other with their horns; here and
there on the mountains noble steeds,
which moved (their manes floating on
the breeze) with a haughty trot along
the hills&mdash;such is the frame that encloses
the picture of every Mussulman
village. On this Djoum&aacute;, the
neighbourhood of Bouin&aacute;ki was more
than usually animated. The sun
poured his floods of gold on the dark
walls of the flat-roofed s&aacute;klas, clothing
them with fantastic shadows, and
adding beauty to their forms. In the
distance, crawling along the mountain,
the creaking arbas<a name="footnotetag16" id="footnotetag16"></a><a href="#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a> flitted among
the grave-stones of a little burial-ground ... past
them, before
them, flew a horseman, raising the
dust along the road ... the mountain
crest and the boundless sea gave
grandeur to this picture, and all nature
breathed a glow of life.</p>

<p>&quot;He comes, he comes!&quot; was murmured
through the crowd; all was in
motion. The horsemen, who till now
had been chattering with their acquaintance
on foot, or disorderedly
riding about the meadow, now leaped
upon their steeds, and dashed forward
to meet the cavalcade which was descending
to the plain: it was Ammal&aacute;t
Bek, the nephew of the Shamkh&aacute;l<a name="footnotetag17" id="footnotetag17"></a><a href="#footnote17"><sup>17</sup></a>
of Tarki, with his suite. He
was habited in a black Persian cloak,
edged with gold-lace, the hanging
sleeves thrown back over his shoulders.
A Turkish shawl was wound
round his arkhalo&uacute;kh, which was made
of flowered silk. Red shalw&aacute;rs were
lost in his yellow high-heeled riding-boots.
His gun, dagger, and
pistol, glittered with gold and silver
arabesque work. The hilt of his
sabre was enriched with gems. The
Prince of Tarki was a tall, well-made
youth, of frank countenance; black
curls streamed behind his ears from
under his cap&mdash;a slight mustache
shaded his upper lip&mdash;his eyes glittered
with a proud courtesy. He rode
a bright bay steed, which fretted under
his hand like a whirlwind. Contrary
to custom, the horse's caparison was
not the round Persian housing, embroidered
all over with silk, but the
light Circassian saddle, ornamented
with silver on a black ground; and
the stirrups were of the black steel of
Kharam&aacute;n, inlaid with gold. Twenty
no&uacute;kers<a name="footnotetag18" id="footnotetag18"></a><a href="#footnote18"><sup>18</sup></a> on spirited horses, and
dressed in cloaks glittering with lace,
their caps cocked jauntily, and leaning
affectedly on one side, pranced
and sidled after him. The people
respectfully stood up before their Bek,
and bowed, pressing their right hand
upon their right knee. A murmur of
whispered approbation followed the
young chief as he passed among the
women. Arrived at the southern extremity
of the ground, Ammal&aacute;t stopped.
The chief people, the old men
leaning upon their sticks, and the
elders of Bouin&aacute;ki, stood round in a
circle to catch a kind word from the
Bek; but Ammal&aacute;t did not pay them
any particular attention, and with cold
politeness replied in monosyllables to
the flatteries and obeisances of his inferiors.
He waved his hand; this was
the signal to commence the race.</p>

<p>Twenty of the most fiery horsemen
dashed forward, without the slightest
order or regularity, galloping onward
and back again, placing themselves in
all kinds of attitudes, and alternately
passing each other. At one moment
<a class="pagenum" name="page290" id="page290" title="page290"></a>they jostled one another from the
course, and at the same time held in
their horses, then again they let them
go at full gallop over the plain. After
this, they each took slender sticks,
called djigid&iacute;s, and darted them as they
rode, either in the charge or the pursuit,
and again seizing them as they
flew, or picking them up from the
earth. Several tumbled from their
saddles under the strong blows; and
then resounded the loud laugh of the
spectators, while loud applauses greeted
the conqueror; sometimes the horses
stumbled, and the riders were thrown
over their heads, hurled off by a double
force from the shortness of their
stirrups. Then commenced the shooting.
Ammal&aacute;t Bek had remained a
little apart, looking on with apparent
pleasure. His no&uacute;kers, one after the
other, had joined the crowd of djig&iacute;terers,
so that, at last, only two were
left by his side. For some time he
was immovable, and followed with
an indifferent gaze the imitation of an
Asiatic combat; but by degrees his
interest grew stronger. At first he
watched the cavaliers with great attention,
then he began to encourage
them by his voice and gestures, he
rose higher in his stirrups, and at last
the warrior-blood boiled in his veins,
when his favourite no&uacute;ker could not
hit a cap which he had thrown down
before him. He snatched his gun
from his attendants, and dashed forward
like an arrow, winding among
the sporters. &quot;Make way&mdash;make way!&quot;
was heard around, and all, dispersing
like a rain-cloud on either side, gave
place to Ammal&aacute;t Bek.</p>

<p>At the distance of a verst<a name="footnotetag19" id="footnotetag19"></a><a href="#footnote19"><sup>19</sup></a> stood ten
poles with caps hanging on them.
Ammal&aacute;t rode straight up to them,
waved his gun round his head, and
turned close round the pole; as he
turned he stood up in his stirrups,
turned back&mdash;bang!&mdash;the cap tumbled
to the ground; without checking his
speed he reloaded, the reins hanging
on his horse's neck&mdash;knocked off another,
then a third&mdash;and so on the
whole ten. A murmur of applause
arose on all sides; but Ammal&aacute;t,
without stopping, threw his gun into
the hands of one of his no&uacute;kers, pulled
out a pistol from his belt, and with
the ball struck the shoe from the hind
foot of his horse; the shoe flew off,
and fell far behind him; he then again
took his gun from his no&uacute;ker, and
ordered him to gallop on before him.
Quicker than thought both darted
forward. When half-way round the
course, the no&uacute;ker drew from his
pocket a rouble, and threw it up in
the air. Ammal&aacute;t raised himself in
the saddle, without waiting till it fell;
but at the very instant his horse stumbled
with all his four legs together,
and striking the dust with his nostrils,
rolled prostrate. All uttered a cry of
terror; but the dexterous horseman,
standing up in the stirrups, without
losing his seat, or even leaning forward,
as if he had been aware that he
was going to fall, fired rapidly, and
hitting the rouble with his ball, hurled
it far among the people. The crowd
shouted with delight&mdash;&quot;Igeed, igeed!
(bravo!) Alla valla-ha!&quot; But Ammal&aacute;t
Bek, modestly retiring, dismounted
from his steed, and throwing
the reins to his djillad&aacute;r, (groom,) ordered
him immediately to have the
horse shod. The race and the shooting
was continued.</p>

<p>At this moment there rode up to
Ammal&aacute;t his emdj&eacute;k,<a name="footnotetag20" id="footnotetag20"></a><a href="#footnote20"><sup>20</sup></a> Saphir-Ali, the
son of one of the poor beks of Bouin&aacute;ki,
a young man of an agreeable
exterior, and simple, cheerful character.
He had grown up with Ammal&aacute;t,
and therefore treated him with great
familiarity. He leaped from his horse,
and nodding his head, exclaimed&mdash;&quot;No&uacute;ker
M&eacute;met Raso&uacute;l has knocked
up the old cropped<a name="footnotetag21" id="footnotetag21"></a><a href="#footnote21"><sup>21</sup></a> stallion, in trying
to leap him over a ditch seven
paces wide.&quot; &quot;And did he leap it?&quot;
cried Ammal&aacute;t impatiently. &quot;Bring
him instantly to me!&quot; He went to
meet the horse&mdash;and without putting
his foot in the stirrup, leaped into the
saddle, and galloped to the bed of a
mountain-torrent. As he galloped, he
pressed the horse with his knee, but
the wearied animal, not trusting to his
strength, bolted aside on the very
<a class="pagenum" name="page291" id="page291" title="page291"></a>brink, and Ammal&aacute;t was obliged to
make another turn. The second time,
the steed, stimulated by the whip,
reared up on his hind-legs in order to
leap the ditch, but he hesitated, grew
restive, and resisted with his fore-feet.
Ammal&aacute;t grew angry. In vain did
Saphir-Ali entreat him not to force
the horse, which had lost in many a
combat and journey the elasticity of
his limbs. Ammal&aacute;t would not listen
to any thing; but urging him with a
cry, and striking him with his drawn
sabre for the third time, he galloped
him at the ravine; and when, for the
third time, the old horse stopped short
in his stride, not daring to leap, he
struck him so violently on the head
with the hilt of his sabre, that he fell
lifeless on the earth.</p>

<p>&quot;This is the reward of faithful service!&quot;
said Saphir-Ali, compassionately,
as he gazed on the lifeless
steed.</p>

<p>&quot;This is the reward of disobedience!&quot;
replied Ammal&aacute;t, with flashing
eyes.</p>

<p>Seeing the anger of the Bek, all
were silent. The horsemen, however,
continued their djig&iacute;tering.</p>

<p>And suddenly was heard the thunder
of Russian drums, and the bayonets
of Russian soldiers glittered as
they wound over the hill. It was a
company of the Kour&iacute;nsky regiment
of infantry, sent from a detachment
which had been dispatched to Ako&uacute;sh,
then in a state of revolt, under Sheikh
Ali Khan, the banished chief of Derbend.
This company had been protecting
a convoy of supplies from Derbend,
whither it was returning by the
mountain road. The commander of
the company, Captain &mdash;&mdash;, and one
officer with him, rode in front. Before
they had reached the race-course,
the retreat was beaten, and the company
halted, throwing aside their
havresacks and piling their muskets,
but without lighting a fire.</p>

<p>The arrival of a Russian detachment
could have been no novelty to
the inhabitants of Daghest&aacute;n in the
year 1819; and even yet, it must be
confessed, it is an event that gives
them no pleasure. Superstition made
them look on the Russians as eternal
enemies&mdash;enemies, however, vigorous
and able; and they determined, therefore,
not to injure them but in secret,
by concealing their hatred under a
mask of amity. A buzz spread among
the people on the appearance of the
Russians: the women returned by
winding paths to the village, not forgetting,
however, to gaze secretly at
the strangers. The men, on the contrary,
threw fierce glances at them
over their shoulders, and began to assemble
in groups, discussing how they
might best get rid of them, and relieve
themselves from the podv&oacute;d<a name="footnotetag22" id="footnotetag22"></a><a href="#footnote22"><sup>22</sup></a>, and so
on. A multitude of loungers and boys,
however, surrounded the Russians as
they reposed upon the grass. Some
of the Kekkho&uacute;ds (starosts<a name="footnotetag23" id="footnotetag23"></a><a href="#footnote23"><sup>23</sup></a>) and
Tehao&uacute;shes (desi&aacute;tniks<a name="footnotetag24" id="footnotetag24"></a><a href="#footnote24"><sup>24</sup></a>) appointed
by the Russian Government, hastily
advancing to the Captain, pulled off
their caps, after the usual salutation,
&quot;Khot ghialdi!&quot; (welcome!) and
&quot;Yakshimo&uacute;sen, tazamo&uacute;sen, sen-ne-ma-mo&uacute;sen,&quot;
(I greet you,) arrived
at the inevitable question at a meeting
of Asiatics, &quot;What news?&quot;&mdash;&quot;Na
khaber?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The only news with me is, that
my horse has cast a shoe, and the
poor devil is dead lame,&quot; answered
the Captain in pretty good Tartar:
&quot;and here is, just <i>&aacute;propos</i>, a blacksmith!&quot;
he continued, turning to a
broad-shouldered Tartar, who was
filing the fresh-shod hoof of Ammal&aacute;t's
horse. &quot;Koun&aacute;k! (my friend,)&mdash;shoe
my horse&mdash;the shoes are ready&mdash;'tis
but the clink of a hammer, and
'tis done in a moment!&quot;</p>

<p>The blacksmith turned sulkily towards
the Captain a face tanned by his
forge and by the sun, looked from the
corners of his eyes at his questioner,
stroked the thick mustache which
overshadowed a beard long unrazored,
and which might for its bristles have
done honour to any boar; flattened
his ar&aacute;kshin (bonnet) on his head,
and coolly continued putting away his
tools in their bag.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you understand me, son of a
wolf race?&quot; said the Captain.</p>

<p>&quot;I understand you well,&quot; answered
the blacksmith,&mdash;&quot;you want your
horse shod.&quot;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page292" id="page292" title="page292"></a>&quot;And I should advise you to shoe
him,&quot; replied the Captain, observing
on the part of the Tartar a desire to
jest.</p>

<p>&quot;To-day is a holiday: I will not
work.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will pay you what you like for
your work; but I tell you that, whether
you like it or not, you must do what
I want.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The will of Allah is above ours;
and he does not permit us to work on
Djoum&aacute;. We sin enough for gain on
common days, so on a holiday I do
not wish to buy coals with silver.&quot;<a name="footnotetag25" id="footnotetag25"></a><a href="#footnote25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;But were you not at work just
now, obstinate blockhead? Is not
one horse the same as another?
Besides, mine is a real Mussulman&mdash;look
at the mark<a name="footnotetag26" id="footnotetag26"></a><a href="#footnote26"><sup>26</sup></a>&mdash;the blood of Karab&aacute;kh.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All horses are alike; but not so
those who ride them: Ammal&aacute;t Bek
is my aga (lord.)&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is, if you had taken it into
your head to refuse him, he would have
had your ears cropped; but you will
not work for me, in the hope that I
would not dare to do the same. Very
well, my friend! I certainly will not
crop your ears, but be assured that I
will warm that orthodox back of yours
with two hundred pretty stinging
nogaikas (lashes with a whip) if you
won't leave off your nonsense&mdash;do you
hear?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hear&mdash;and I answer as I did before:
I will not shoe the horse&mdash;for I
am a good Mussulman.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I will make you shoe him,
because I am a good soldier. As you
have worked at the will of your Bek,
you shall work for the need of a Russian
officer&mdash;without this I cannot proceed.
Corporals, forward!&quot;</p>

<p>In the mean time a circle of gazers
had been extending round the obstinate
blacksmith, like a ring made in
the water by casting a stone into it.
Some in the crowd were disputing the
best places, hardly knowing what they
were running to see; and at last more
cries were heard: &quot;It is not fair&mdash;it
cannot be: to-day is a holiday: to-day
it is a sin to work!&quot; Some of the
boldest, trusting to their numbers,
pulled their caps over their eyes, and
felt at the hilts of their daggers, pressing
close up to the Captain, and crying
&quot;Don't shoe him, Al&eacute;kper! Do
nothing for him: here's news, my masters!
What new prophets for us are
these unwashed Russians?&quot; The Captain
was a brave man, and thoroughly
understood the Asiatics. &quot;Away, ye
rascals!&quot; he cried in a rage, laying
his hand on the butt of his pistol. &quot;Be
silent, or the first that dares to let an
insult pass his teeth, shall have them
closed with a leaden seal!&quot;</p>

<p>This threat, enforced by the bayonets
of some of the soldiers, succeeded
immediately: they who were timid
took to their heels&mdash;the bolder held
their tongues. Even the orthodox
blacksmith, seeing that the affair was
becoming serious, looked round on all
sides, and muttered &quot;Nedjelaim?&quot;
(What can I do?) tucked up his
sleeves, pulled out from his bag the
hammer and pincers, and began to
shoe the Russian's horse, grumbling
between his teeth, &quot;<i>Vala billa beetmi
eddeem</i>, (I will not do it, by God!)&quot;
It must be remarked that all this took
place out of Ammal&aacute;t's presence. He
had hardly looked at the Russians,
when, in order to avoid a disagreeable
rencontre, he mounted the horse
which had just been shod, and galloped
off to Bouin&aacute;ki, where his house
was situated.</p>

<p>While this was taking place at one
end of the exercising ground, a horseman
rode up to the front of the
reposing soldiers. He was of middling
stature, but of athletic frame, and was
clothed in a shirt of linked mail, his
head protected by a helmet, and in
full warlike equipment, and followed
by five no&uacute;kers. By their dusty
dress, and the foam which covered
their horses, it might be seen that they
had ridden far and fast. The first
horseman, fixing his eye on the soldiers,
advanced slowly along the piles
of muskets, upsetting the two pyramids
of fire-arms. The no&uacute;kers, following
the steps of their master, far
from turning aside, coolly rode over
the scattered weapons. The sentry,
who had challenged them while they were
yet at some distance, and warned
them not to approach, seized the bit
<a class="pagenum" name="page293" id="page293" title="page293"></a>of the steed bestridden by the mail-coated
horseman, while the rest of the
soldiers, enraged at such an insult
from a Mussulman, assailed the party
with abuse. &quot;Hold hard! Who are
you?&quot; was the challenge and question
of the sentinel. &quot;Thou must be a
raw recruit if thou knowest not Sultan
Akhmet Khan of Av&aacute;r,&quot;<a name="footnotetag27" id="footnotetag27"></a><a href="#footnote27"><sup>27</sup></a> coolly
answered the man in mail, shaking off
the hand of the sentry from his reins.
&quot;I think last year I left the Russians
a keepsake at B&aacute;shli. Translate that
for him,&quot; he said to one of his no&uacute;kers.
The Av&aacute;retz repeated his words
in pretty intelligible Russian.</p>

<p>&quot;'Tis Akhmet Khan! Akhmet
Khan!&quot; shouted the soldiers. &quot;Seize
him! hold him fast! down with him!
pay him for the affair of B&aacute;shli<a name="footnotetag28" id="footnotetag28"></a><a href="#footnote28"><sup>28</sup></a>&mdash;the
villains cut our wounded to pieces.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Away, brute!&quot; cried Sultan Akhmet
Khan to the soldier who had again
seized the bridle of his horse&mdash;&quot;I am
a Russian general.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A Russian traitor!&quot; roared a multitude
of voices; &quot;bring him to the
Captain: drag him to Derbend, to
Colonel Verkh&oacute;ffsky.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Tis only to hell I would go with
such guides!&quot; said Akhmet, with a
contemptuous smile, and making his
horse rear, he turned him to the right
and left; then, with a blow of the
nogaik,<a name="footnotetag29" id="footnotetag29"></a><a href="#footnote29"><sup>29</sup></a> he made him leap into the
air, and disappeared. The no&uacute;kers
kept their eye on the movements of
their chief, and uttering their warcry,
followed his steps, and overthrowing
several of the soldiers, cleared a
way for themselves into the road. After
galloping off to a distance of scarce
a hundred paces, the Khan rode away
at a slow walk, with an expression of
the greatest <i>sang-froid</i>, not deigning
to look back, and coolly playing with
his bridle. The crowd of Tartars
assembled round the blacksmith attracted
his attention. &quot;What are
you quarrelling about, friends?&quot; asked
Akhmet Khan of the nearest, reining
in his horse.</p>

<p>In sign of respect and reverence,
they all applied their hands to their
foreheads when they saw the Khan.
The timid or peaceably disposed among
them, dreading the consequences, either
from the Russians or the Khan, to
which this rencontre might expose
them, exhibited much discomfiture at
the question; but the idle, the ruffian,
and the desperate&mdash;for all beheld with
hatred the Russian domination&mdash;crowded
turbulently round him with
delight. They hurriedly told him
what was the matter.</p>

<p>&quot;And you stand, like buffaloes,
stupidly looking on, while they force
your brother to work like a brute
under the yoke!&quot; exclaimed the Khan,
gloomily, to the bystanders; &quot;while
they laugh in your face at your customs,
and trample your faith under
their feet! and ye whine like old women,
instead of revenging yourselves
like men! Cowards! cowards!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What can we do?&quot; cried a multitude
of voices together; &quot;the Russians
have cannon&mdash;they have bayonets!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And ye, have ye not guns? have
ye not daggers? It is not the Russians
that are brave, but ye that are
cowards! Shame of Mussulmans!
The sword of Daghest&aacute;n trembles
before the Russian whip. Ye are
afraid of the roll of the cannon; but
ye fear not the reproach of cowardice.
The ferm&aacute;n of a Russian pr&iacute;stav<a name="footnotetag30" id="footnotetag30"></a><a href="#footnote30"><sup>30</sup></a> is
holier to you than a chapter of the
Koran. Siberia frightens you more
than hell. Did your forefathers act,
did your forefathers think thus? They
counted not their enemies, they calculated
not. Outnumbered or not,
they met them, bravely fought them,
and gloriously died! And what fear
ye? Have the Russians ribs of iron?
Have their cannon no breach? Is it
not by the tail that you seize the scorpion?&quot;
This address stirred the crowd.
The Tartar vanity was touched to the
quick. &quot;What do we care for them?
Why do we let them lord it over us
<a class="pagenum" name="page294" id="page294" title="page294"></a>here?&quot; was heard around. &quot;Let us
liberate the blacksmith from his work&mdash;let
us liberate him!&quot; they roared, as
they narrowed their circle round the
Russian soldiers, amidst whom Al&eacute;kper
was shoeing the captain's horse.
The confusion increased. Satisfied
with the tumult he had created, Sultan
Akhmet Khan, not wishing to mix
himself up in an insignificant brawl,
rode out of the crowd, leaving two
no&uacute;kers to keep alive the violent spirit
among the Tartars, while, accompanied
by the remainder, he rode rapidly
to the ootakh<a name="footnotetag31" id="footnotetag31"></a><a href="#footnote31"><sup>31</sup></a> of Ammal&aacute;t.</p>

<p>&quot;Mayest thou be victorious,&quot; said
Sultan Akhmet Khan to Ammal&aacute;t
Bek, who received him at the threshold.
This ordinary salutation, in the
Circassian language, was pronounced
with so marked an emphasis, that
Ammal&aacute;t as he kissed him, asked,
&quot;Is that a jest or a prophecy, my fair
guest?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That depends on thee,&quot; replied
the Sultan. &quot;It is upon the right
heir of the Shamkhal&aacute;t<a name="footnotetag32" id="footnotetag32"></a><a href="#footnote32"><sup>32</sup></a> that it
depends to draw the sword from the
scabbard.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To sheath it no more, Khan? An
unenviable destiny. Methinks it is
better to reign in Bouin&aacute;ki, than for
an empty title to be obliged to hide
in the mountains like a jackal.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To bound from the mountains like
a lion, Ammal&aacute;t; and to repose, after
your glorious toils, in the palace of
your ancestors.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To repose? Is it not better not
to be awakened at all?</p>

<p>&quot;Would you behold but in a dream
what you ought to possess in reality?
The Russians are giving you the
poppy, and will lull you with tales,
while another plucks the golden
flowers of the garden.&quot;<a name="footnotetag33" id="footnotetag33"></a><a href="#footnote33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;What can I do with my force?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Force&mdash;that is in thy soul,
Ammal&aacute;t!... Despise dangers and
they bend before you.... Dost thou
hear that?&quot; added Sultan Akhmet
Khan, as the sound of firing reached
them from the town. &quot;It is the voice
of victory!&quot;</p>

<p>Saphir-Ali rushed into the chamber
with an agitated face.</p>

<p>&quot;Bouin&aacute;ki is in revolt,&quot; he hurriedly
began; &quot;a crowd of rioters
has overpowered the detachment, and
they have begun to fire from the
rocks.&quot;<a name="footnotetag34" id="footnotetag34"></a><a href="#footnote34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;Rascals!&quot; cried Ammal&aacute;t, as he
threw his gun over his shoulder.
&quot;How dared they to rise without me!
Run, Saphir-Ali, threaten them with
my name; kill the first who disobeys.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have done all I could to restrain
them,&quot; said Saphir-Ali, &quot;but none
would listen to me, for the no&uacute;kers of
Sultan Akhmet Khan were urging
them on, saying that he had ordered
them to slay the Russians.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed! did my no&uacute;kers say
that?&quot; asked the Khan.</p>

<p>&quot;They did not say so much, but
they set the example,&quot; said Saphir-Ali.</p>

<p>&quot;In that case they have done well,&quot;
replied Sultan Akhmet Khan: &quot;this
is brave!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What hast thou done, Khan!&quot;
cried Ammal&aacute;t, angrily.</p>

<p>&quot;What you might have done long
ago!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How can I justify myself to the
Russians?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;With lead and steel.... The
firing is begun.... Fate works for
you ... the sword is drawn ... let us
go seek the Russians!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They are here!&quot; cried the Captain,
who, followed by two men, had
broken through the disorderly ranks
of the Tartars, and dashed into the
house of their chief. Confounded by
the unexpected outbreak in which
he was certain to be considered a
party, Ammal&aacute;t saluted his enraged
<a class="pagenum" name="page295" id="page295" title="page295"></a>guest&mdash;&quot;Come in peace!&quot; he said to
him in Tartar.</p>

<p>&quot;I care not whether I come in
peace or no,&quot; answered the Captain,
&quot;but I find no peaceful reception in
Bouin&aacute;ki. Thy Tartars, Ammal&aacute;t,
have dared to fire upon a soldier of
mine, of yours, a subject of our
Tsar.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In very deed, 'twas absurd to fire
on a Russian,&quot; said the Khan, contemptuously
stretching himself on the
cushions of the divan, &quot;when they
might have cut his throat.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Here is the cause of all the mischief,
Ammal&aacute;t!&quot; said the Captain,
angrily, pointing to the Khan; &quot;but
for this insolent rebel not a trigger
would have been pulled in Bouin&aacute;ki!
But you have done well, Ammal&aacute;t
Bek, to invite Russians as friends,
and to receive their foe as a guest, to
shelter him as a comrade, to honour
him as a friend! Ammal&aacute;t Bek, this
man is named in the order of the
commander-in-chief; give him up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Captain,&quot; answered Ammal&aacute;t,
&quot;with us a guest is sacred. To give
him up would be a sin upon my soul,
an ineffaceable shame upon my head;
respect my entreaty; respect our
customs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will tell you, in your turn&mdash;respect
the Russian laws. Remember
your duty. You have sworn allegiance
to the Tsar, and your oath obliges
you not to spare your own brother
if he is a criminal.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rather would I give up my brother
than my guest, Sir Captain! It
is not for you to judge my promises
and obligations. My tribunal is Allah
and the padishah! In the field,
let fortune take care of the Khan;
but within my threshold, beneath my
roof, I am bound to be his protector,
and I will be!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you shall be answerable for
this traitor!&quot;</p>

<p>The Khan had lain in haughty silence
during this dispute, breathing
the smoke from his pipe: but at the
word &quot;traitor,&quot; his blood was fired,
he started up, and rushed indignantly
to the Captain.</p>

<p>&quot;Traitor, say you?&quot; he cried.
&quot;Say rather, that I refused to betray
him to whom I was bound by promise.
The Russian padishah gave
me rank, the sardar<a name="footnotetag35" id="footnotetag35"></a><a href="#footnote35"><sup>35</sup></a> caressed me&mdash;and
I was faithful so long as they demanded
of me nothing impossible or
humiliating. But, all of a sudden, they
wished me to admit troops into Av&aacute;r&mdash;to
permit fortresses to be built
there; and what name should I have
deserved, if I had sold the blood and
sweat of the Av&aacute;retzes, my brethren!
If I had attempted this, think ye that
I could have done it? A thousand
free daggers, a thousand unhired bullets,
would have flown to the heart of
the betrayer. The very rocks would
have fallen on the son who could betray
his father. I refused the friendship
of the Russians; but I was not
their enemy&mdash;and what was the reward
of my just intentions, my honest
counsels? I was deeply, personally
insulted by the letter of one of your
generals, whom I had warned. That
insolence cost him dear at B&aacute;shli ... I
shed a river of blood for some few
drops of insulting ink, and that river
divides us for ever.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That blood cries for vengeance!&quot;
replied the enraged Captain. &quot;Thou
shalt not escape it, robber!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nor thou from me!&quot; shouted the
infuriated Khan, plunging his dagger
into the body of the Captain, as he
lifted his hand to seize him by the collar.
Severely wounded, the officer
fell groaning on the carpet.</p>

<p>&quot;Thou hast undone me!&quot; cried
Ammal&aacute;t, wringing his hands. &quot;He
is a Russian, and my guest!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There are insults which a roof
cannot cover,&quot; sullenly replied the
Khan. &quot;The die is cast: it is no
time to hesitate. Shut your gate, call
your people, and let us attack the
enemy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;An hour ago I had no enemy ... there
are no means now for repulsing
them ... I have neither powder nor
ball ... The people are dispersed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They have fled!&quot; cried Saphir-Ali
in despair. &quot;The Russians are
advancing at full march over the hill.
They are close at hand!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If so, go with me, Ammal&aacute;t!&quot;
said the Khan. &quot;I rode to Tchetchn&aacute;
yesterday, to raise the revolt along
<a class="pagenum" name="page296" id="page296" title="page296"></a>the line ... What will be the end,
God knows; but there is bread in the
mountains. Do you consent?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let us go!&quot; ... replied Ammal&aacute;t,
resolvedly.... &quot;When our
only safety is in flight, it is no time
for disputes and reproaches.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ho! horses, and six no&uacute;kers with
me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And am I to go with you?&quot; said
Saphir-Ali, with tears in his eyes&mdash;&quot;with
you for weal or woe!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, my good Saphir-Ali, no.
Remain you here to govern the household,
that our people and the strangers
may not seize every thing. Give my
greeting to my wife, and take her
to my father-in-law, the Shamkh&aacute;l.
Forget me not, and farewell!&quot;</p>

<p>They had barely time to escape at
full gallop by one gate, when the Russians
dashed in at the other.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>The vernal noon was shining upon
the peaks of Caucasus, and the loud
voices of the moollahs had called the
inhabitants of Tchetchn&aacute; to prayer.
By degrees they came forth from the
mosques, and though invisible to each
other from the towers on which they
stood, their solitary voices, after awaking
for a moment the echoes of the
hills, sank to stillness in the silent
air.</p>

<p>The moollah, Hadji Suleiman, a
Turkish devotee, one of those missionaries
annually sent into the mountains
by the Divan of Stamboul, to
spread and strengthen the faith, and
to increase the detestation felt by the
inhabitants for the Russians, was reposing
on the roof of the mosque,
having performed the usual call, ablution,
and prayer. He had not been long
installed as moollah of Ig&aacute;li, a
village of Tchetchn&aacute;; and plunged in
a deep contemplation of his hoary
beard, and the circling smoke-wreaths
that rose from his pipe, he gazed from
time to time with a curious interest
on the mountains, and on the defiles
which lay towards the north, right
before his eyes. On the left arose the
precipitous ridges dividing Tchetchn&aacute;
from Av&aacute;r, and beyond them glittered
the snows of Caucasus; s&aacute;klas scattered
disorderly along the ridges half-way
up the mountain, and narrow
paths led to these fortresses built by
nature, and employed by the hill-robbers
to defend their liberty, or secure
their plunder. All was still in the
village and the surrounding hills;
there was not a human being to be
seen on the roads or streets; flocks of
sheep were reposing in the shade of
the cliffs; the buffaloes were crowded
in the muddy swamps near the springs,
with only their muzzles protruded
from the marsh. Nought save the
hum of the insects&mdash;nought save the
monotonous chirp of the grasshoppers
indicated life amid the breathless
silence of the mountains; and Hadji
Suleiman, stretched under the cupola,
was intensely enjoying the stillness
and repose of nature, so congenial to
the lazy immobility of the Turkish
character. Indolently he turned his
eyes, whose fire was extinguished, and
which no longer reflected the light of
the sun, and at length they fell upon
two horsemen, slowly climbing the
opposite side of the declivity.</p>

<p>&quot;N&eacute;phtali!&quot; cried our Moollah,
turning towards a neighbouring s&aacute;kla,
at the gate of which stood a saddled
horse. And then a handsome Tchetchenetz,
with short cut beard, and
shaggy cap covering half his face, ran
out into the street. &quot;I see two horsemen,&quot;
continued the Moollah; &quot;they
are riding round the village!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Most likely Jews or Armenians,&quot;
answered N&eacute;phtali. &quot;They do not
choose to hire a guide, and will break
their necks in the winding road. The
wild-goats, and our boldest riders,
would not plunge into these recesses
without precaution.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, brother N&eacute;phtali; I have
been twice to Mecca, and have seen
plenty of Jews and Armenians every
where. But these riders look not like
Hebrew chafferers, unless, indeed, they
exchange steel for gold in the mountain
road. They have no bales of
merchandise. Look at them yourself
from above; your eyes are surer than
mine; mine have had their day, and
done their work. There was a time
when I could count the buttons on a
Russian soldier's coat a verst off, and
<a class="pagenum" name="page297" id="page297" title="page297"></a>my rifle never missed an infidel; but
now I could not distinguish a ram of
my own afar.&quot;</p>

<p>By this time N&eacute;phtali was at the
side of the Moollah, and was examining
the travellers with an eagle
glance.</p>

<p>&quot;The noonday is hot, and the road
rugged,&quot; said Suleiman; &quot;invite the
travellers to refresh themselves and
their horses: perhaps they have news:
besides, the Koran commands us to
show hospitality.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;With us in the mountains, and
before the Koran, never did a stranger
leave a village hungry or sad; never
did he depart without tchourek,<a name="footnotetag36" id="footnotetag36"></a><a href="#footnote36"><sup>36</sup></a> without
blessing, without a guide; but these
people are suspicious: why do they
avoid honest men, and pass our village
by by-roads, and with danger to their
life?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It seems that they are your countrymen,&quot;
said Suleiman, shading his
eyes with his hand: &quot;their dress is
Tchetchn&aacute;. Perhaps they are returning
from a plundering exhibition, to
which your father went with a hundred
of his neighbours; or perhaps they are
brothers, going to revenge blood for
blood.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Suleiman, that is not like us.
Could a mountaineer's heart refrain
from coming to see his countrymen&mdash;to
boast of his exploits against the
Russians, and to show his booty?
These are neither avengers of blood
nor Abreks&mdash;their faces are not covered
by the b&aacute;shlik; besides, dress is deceptive.
Who can tell that those are
not Russian deserters! The other
day a K&aacute;zak, who had murdered his
master, fled from Goumbet-Ao&uacute;l with
his horse and arms.... The devil is
strong!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is strong in them in whom
the faith is weak, N&eacute;phtali;&mdash;yet, if
I mistake not, the hinder horseman
has hair flowing from under his cap.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;May I be pounded to dust, but it
is so! It is either a Russian, or, what
is worse, a Tartar Shageed.<a name="footnotetag37" id="footnotetag37"></a><a href="#footnote37"><sup>37</sup></a> Stop a
moment, my friend; I will comb your
zilfl&aacute;rs for you! In half-an-hour I will
return, Suleiman, either with them,&mdash;or
one of us three shall feed the mountain
berkoots (eagles.)&quot;</p>

<p>N&eacute;phtali rushed down the stairs,
threw the gun on his shoulders, leapt
into his saddle and dashed down the
hill, caring neither for furrow nor stone.
Only the dust arose, and the pebbles
streamed down after the bold horseman.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Alla akb&eacute;r!&quot; gravely exclaimed
Suleiman, and lit his pipe.</p>

<p>N&eacute;phtali soon came up with the
strangers. Their horses were covered
with foam, and the sweat-drops rained
from them on the narrow path by
which they were climbing the mountain.
The first was clothed in a shirt
of mail, the other in the Circassian
dress: except that he wore a Persian
sabre instead of a sh&aacute;shka,<a name="footnotetag38" id="footnotetag38"></a><a href="#footnote38"><sup>38</sup></a> suspended
by a laced girdle. His left arm was
covered with blood, bound up with a
handkerchief, and supported by the
sword-knot. The faces of both were
concealed. For some time he rode
behind them along the slippery path,
which overhung a precipice; but at
the first open space he galloped by
them, and turned his horse round.
&quot;Sal&aacute;m aleikom!&quot; said he, opposing
their passage along the rugged and
half-built road among the rocks, as he
made ready his arms. The foremost
horseman suddenly wrapped his bo&uacute;rka<a name="footnotetag39" id="footnotetag39"></a><a href="#footnote39"><sup>39</sup></a>
round his face, so as to leave
visible only his knit brows: &quot;Aleikom
Sal&aacute;m!&quot; answered he, cocking his
gun, and fixing himself in the saddle.</p>

<p>&quot;God give you a good journey!&quot;
said N&eacute;phtali. repeating the usual salutation,
and preparing, at the first
hostile movement, to shoot the stranger.</p>

<p>&quot;God give you enough of sense not
to interrupt the traveller,&quot; replied his
antagonist, impatiently: &quot;What would
you with us, Koun&aacute;k?&quot;<a name="footnotetag40" id="footnotetag40"></a><a href="#footnote40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p>&quot;I offer you rest, and a brother's
repast, barley and stalls for your horses.
<a class="pagenum" name="page298" id="page298" title="page298"></a>My threshold flourishes by hospitality:
the blessing of the stranger increaseth
the flock, and giveth sharpness to the
sword of the master. Fix not the seal
of reproach on our whole village. Let
them not say, 'They have seen travellers
in the heat of noon, and
have not refreshed them nor sheltered
them.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We thank you for your kindness;
but we are not wont to take forced
hospitality; and haste is even more
necessary for us than rest.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You ride to your death without a
guide.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Guide!&quot; exclaimed the traveller;
&quot;I know every step of the Caucasus.
I have been where your serpents
climb not, your tigers cannot mount,
your eagles cannot fly. Make way,
comrade: thy threshold is not on
God's high-road, and I have no time
to prate with thee.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will not yield a step, till I know
who and whence you are!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Insolent scoundrel, out of my way,
or thy mother shall beg thy bones
from the jackall and the wind! Thank
your luck, N&eacute;phtali, that thy father
and I have eaten one another's salt;
and often have ridden by his side in
the battle. Unworthy son! thou art
rambling about the roads, and ready to
attack the peaceable travellers, while
thy father's corse lies rotting on the
fields of Russia, and the wives of the
Kaz&aacute;ks are selling his arms in the
bazar. N&eacute;phtali, thy father was slain
yesterday beyond the T&eacute;rek. Dost
thou know me now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sultan Akhmet Khan!&quot; cried the
Tchetchenetz, struck by the piercing
look and by the terrible news. His
voice was stifled, and he fell forward
on his horse's neck in inexpressible
grief.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I am Sultan Akhmet Khan!
but grave this in your memory, N&eacute;phtali&mdash;that
if you say to any one, 'I
have seen the Khan of Av&aacute;r,' my vengeance
will live from generation to
generation.&quot;</p>

<p>The strangers passed on, the Khan
in silence, plunged, as it seemed, in
painful recollections; Ammal&aacute;t (for it
was he) in gloomy thought. The dress
of both bore witness to recent fighting;
their mustaches were singed by the
priming, and splashes of blood had
dried upon their faces; but the proud
look of the first seemed to defy to the
combat fate and chance; a gloomy
smile, of hate mingled with scorn, contracted
his lip. On the other hand,
on the features of Ammal&aacute;t exhaustion
was painted. He could hardly turn
his languid eyes; and from time to time
a groan escaped him, caused by the
pain of his wounded arm. The uneasy
pace of the Tartar horse, unaccustomed
to the mountain roads, renewed
the torment of his wound. He
was the first to break the silence.</p>

<p>&quot;Why have you refused the offer of
these good people? We might have
stopped an hour or two to repose,
and at dewfall we could have proceeded.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You think so, because you feel
like a young man, dear Ammal&aacute;t: you
are used to rule your Tartars like
slaves, and you fancy that you can
conduct yourself with the same ease
among the free mountaineers. The
hand of fate weighs heavily upon us;&mdash;we
are defeated and flying. Hundreds
of brave mountaineers&mdash;your
no&uacute;kers and my own&mdash;have fallen in
fight with the Russians; and the
Tchetchenetz has seen turned to flight
the face of Sultan Akhmet Khan,
which they are wont to behold the
star of victory! To accept the beggar's
repast, perhaps to hear reproaches
for the death of fathers and sons, carried
away by me in this rash expedition&mdash;'twould
be to lose their confidence
for ever. Time will pass, tears
will dry up; the thirst of vengeance
will take place of grief for the dead;
and then again Sultan Akhmet will be
seen the prophet of plunder and of
blood. Then again the battle-signal
shall echo through the mountains, and
I shall once more lead flying bands of
avengers into the Russian limits. If I
go now, in the moment of defeat, the
Tchetchenetz will judge that Allah
giveth and taketh away victory. They
may offend me by rash words, and
with me an offence is ineffaceable; and
the revenge of a personal offence would
obstruct the road that leads me to the
Russians. Why, then, provoke a quarrel
with a brave people&mdash;and destroy
the idol of glory on which they are
wont to gaze with rapture? Never
does man appear so mean as in weakness,
when every one can measure
his strength with him fearlessly: besides,
you need a skilful leech, and
nowhere will you find a better than at
my house. To-morrow we shall be at
home; have patience until then.&quot;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page299" id="page299" title="page299"></a>With a gesture of gratitude Ammal&aacute;t
Bek placed his hand upon his heart
and forehead: he perfectly felt the
truth of the Khan's words, but exhaustion
for many hours had been
overwhelming him. Avoiding the villages,
they passed the night among the
rocks, eating a handful of millet boiled
in honey, without the mountaineers
seldom set out on a journey.
Crossing the Koi-So&uacute; by the bridge
near the Ashe&eacute;rt, quitting its northern
branch, and leaving behind them
And&eacute;h, and the country of the Boulin&eacute;tzes
of the Koi-So&uacute;, and the naked
chain of Salata&oacute;u. A rude path lay
before them, winding among forests
and cliffs terrible to body and soul;
and they began to climb the last chain
which separated them on the north
from Khounz&aacute;kh or Av&aacute;r, the capital of
the Khans. The forest, and then the
underwood, had gradually disappeared
from the naked flint of the mountain,
on which cloud and tempest could
hardly wander. To reach the summit,
our travellers were compelled to ride
alternately to the right and to the left,
so precipitous was the ascent of the
rocks. The experienced steed of the
Khan stepped cautiously and surely
from stone to stone, feeling his way
with his hoofs, and when they slipped,
gliding on his haunches down the declivities:
while the ardent fiery horse
of Ammal&aacute;t, trained in the hills of
Daghest&aacute;n, fretted, curveted, and
slipped. Deprived of his customary
grooming, he could not support a two
days' flight under the intense cold
and burning sunshine of the mountains,
travelling among sharp rocks, and
nourished only by the scanty herbage
of the crevices. He snorted heavily
as he climbed higher and higher; the
sweat streamed from his poitrel; his
large nostrils were dry and parched,
and foam boiled from his bit. &quot;Allah
berek&eacute;t!&quot; exclaimed Ammal&aacute;t, as
he reached the crest from which there
opened before him a view of Av&aacute;r:
but at the very moment his exhausted
horse fell under him; the blood spouted
from his open mouth, and his last
breath burst the saddle-girth.</p>

<p>The Khan assisted the Bek to extricate
himself from the stirrups; but
observed with alarm that his efforts
had displaced the bandage on Ammal&aacute;t's
wounded arm, and that the blood
was soaking through it afresh. The
young man, it seemed, was insensible
to pain; tears were rolling down his
face upon the dead horse. So one
drop fills not, but overflows the cup.
&quot;Thou wilt never more bear me like
down upon the wind,&quot; he said, &quot;nor
hear behind thee from the dust-cloud
of the race, the shouts, unpleasing to
the rival, the acclamations of the
people: in the blaze of battle no more
shalt thou carry me from the iron rain
of the Russian cannon. With thee I
gained the fame of a warrior&mdash;why
should I survive, or it, or thee?&quot; He
bent his face upon his knee, and remained
silent a long time, while the
Khan carefully bound up his wounded
arm: at length Ammal&aacute;t raised his
head: &quot;Leave me!&quot; he cried, resolutely:
&quot;leave, Sultan Akhmet Khan,
a wretch to his fate! The way is long,
and I am exhausted. By remaining
with me, you will perish in vain. See!
the eagle soars around us; he knows
that my heart will soon quiver beneath
his talons, and I thank God! Better
find an airy grave in the maw of a bird
of prey, than leave my corse beneath
a Christian foot. Farewell, linger
not.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For shame, Ammal&aacute;t! you trip
against a straw....! What
the great harm? You are wounded,
and your horse is dead. Your wound
will soon healed, and we will find
you a better horse! Allah sendeth not
misfortunes alone. In the flower of
your age, and the full vigour of your
faculties, it is a sin to despair. Mount
my horse, I will lead him by the bridle,
and by night we shall be at home.
Time is precious!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For me, time is no more, Sultan
Ahkmet Khan ... I thank you
heartily for your brotherly care, but I
cannot take advantage of it ... you
yourself cannot support a march on
foot after such fatigue. I repeat ...
leave me to my fate. Here, on these
inaccessible heights, I will die free and
contented ... And what is there to
recall me to life! My parents lie under
the earth, my wife is blind, my uncle
and father-in-law the Shamkh&aacute;l are
cowering at Tarki before the Russians
... the Giaour is revelling in my
native land, in my inheritance; and I
myself an a wanderer from my home,
a runaway from battle. I neither can,
nor ought to live.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You ought <i>not</i> to talk such nonsense,
dear Ammal&aacute;t:&mdash;and nothing
but fever can excuse you. We are
<a class="pagenum" name="page300" id="page300" title="page300"></a>created that we may live longer than
our fathers. For wives, if one has
not teazed you enough, we will find
you three more. If you love not the
Shamkh&aacute;l, yet love your own inheritance&mdash;you
ought to live, if but for
that; since to a dead man power is
useless, and victory impossible. Revenge
on the Russians is a holy duty:
live, if but for that. That we are
beaten, is no novelty for a warrior;
to-day luck is theirs, to-morrow it falls
to us. Allah gives fortune; but a man
creates his own glory, not by fortune,
but by firmness. Take courage, my
friend Ammal&aacute;t.... You are
wounded and weak; I am strong from
habit, and not fatigued by flight.
Mount! and we may yet live to beat
the Russians.&quot;</p>

<p>The colour returned to Ammal&aacute;t's
face ... &quot;Yes, I will live for revenge!&quot;
he cried: &quot;for revenge both
secret and open. Believe me, Sultan
Akhmet Khan, it is only for this that I
accept your generosity! Henceforth
I am yours; I swear by the graves of
my fathers.... I am yours! Guide
my steps, direct the strokes of my arm;
and if ever, drowned in softness, I forget
my oath, remind me of this moment,
of this mountain peak: Ammal&aacute;t
Bek will awake, and his dagger will
be lightning!&quot;</p>

<p>The Khan embraced him, as he lifted
the excited youth into the saddle.
&quot;Now I behold in you the pure blood
of the Em&iacute;rs!&quot; said he: &quot;the burning
blood of their children, which flows in
our veins like the sulphur in the entrails
of the rocks, which, ever and
anon inflaming, shakes and topples
down the crags.&quot; Steadying with one
hand the wounded man in the saddle,
the Khan began cautiously to descend
the rugged croft. Occasionally the
stones fell rattling from under their
feet, or the horse slid downward over
the smooth granite, so that they were
well pleased to reach the mossy slopes.
By degrees, creeping plants began to
appear, spreading their green sheets;
and, waving from the crevices like fans,
they hung down in long ringlets like
ribbons or flags. At length they reached
a thick wood of nut-trees; then
came the oak, the wild cherry, and,
lower still, the tchin&aacute;r,<a name="footnotetag41" id="footnotetag41"></a><a href="#footnote41"><sup>41</sup></a> and the tchind&aacute;r.
The variety, the wealth of vegetation,
and the majestic silence of the
umbrageous forest, produced a kind of involuntary
adoration of the wild strength
of nature. Ever and anon, from the
midnight darkness of the boughs, there
dawned, like the morning, glimpses of
meadows, covered with a fragrant carpet
of flowers untrodden by the foot
of man. The pathway at one time
lost itself in the depth of the thicket;
at another, crept forth upon the edge
of the rock, below which gleamed and
murmured a rivulet, now foaming over
the stones, then again slumbering on
its rocky bed, under the shade of the
barberry and the eglantine. Pheasants,
sparkling with their rainbow tails,
flitted from shrub to shrub; flights of
wild pigeons flew over the crags, sometimes
in an horizontal troop, sometimes
like a column, rising to the sky; and
sunset flooded all with its airy purple,
and light mists began to rise from the
narrow gorges: every thing breathed
the freshness of evening. Our travellers
were now near the village of Aki,
and separated only by a hill from
Khounz&aacute;kh. A low crest alone divided
them from that village, when
the report of a gun resounded from
the mountain, and, like an ominous
signal, was repeated by the echoes
of the cliffs. The travellers halted
irresolute: the echoes by degrees sank
into stillness. &quot;Our hunters!&quot; cried
Sultan Akhmet Khan, wiping the
sweat from his face: &quot;they expect
me not, and think not to meet me
here! Many tears of joy, and many of
sorrow, do I bear to Khounz&aacute;kh!&quot;
Unfeigned sorrow was expressed in
the face of Akhmet Khan. Vividly
does every soft and every savage sentiment
play on the features of the Asiatic.</p>

<p>Another report soon interrupted his
meditation; then another, and another.
Shot answered shot, and at length
thickened into a warm fire. &quot;'Tis
the Russians!&quot; cried Ammal&aacute;t, drawing
his sabre. He pressed his horse
with the stirrup, as though he would
have leaped over the ridge at a single
bound; but in a moment his strength
failed him, and the blade fell ringing
on the ground, as his arm dropped
heavily by his side. &quot;Khan!&quot; said
he, dismounting, &quot;go to the succour
of your people; your face will be
<a class="pagenum" name="page301" id="page301" title="page301"></a>worth more to them than a hundred
warriors.&quot;</p>

<p>The Khan heard him not; he was
listening intently for the flight of the
balls, as if he would distinguish those
of the Russian from the Av&aacute;rian.
&quot;Have they, besides the agility of the
goat, stolen the wings of the eagle
of Kazb&eacute;c? Can they have reached
our inaccessible fastnesses?&quot; said he,
leaning to the saddle, with his foot already
in the stirrup. &quot;Farewell, Ammal&aacute;t!&quot;
he cried at length, listening to
the firing, which now grew hotter: &quot;I
go to perish on the ruins I have made,
after striking like a thunderbolt!&quot; At
this moment a bullet whistled by, and
fell at his feet. Bending down and
picking it up, his face was lighted with
a smile. He quietly took his foot from
the stirrup, and turning to Ammal&aacute;t,
&quot;Mount!&quot; said he, &quot;you shall presently
find with your own eyes an answer
to this riddle. The Russian bullets
are of lead; but this is copper<a name="footnotetag42" id="footnotetag42"></a><a href="#footnote42"><sup>42</sup></a>&mdash;an
Av&aacute;retz, my dear countryman. Besides,
it comes from the south, where
the Russians cannot be.&quot;</p>

<p>They ascended to the summit of the
crest, and before their view opened two
villages, situated on the opposite sides
of a deep ravine; from behind them
came the firing. The inhabitants
sheltering themselves behind rocks and
hedges, were firing at each other. Between
them the women were incessantly
running, sobbing and weeping
when any combatant, approaching the
edge of the ravine, fell wounded. They
carried stones, and, regardless of the
whistling of the balls, fearlessly piled
them up, so as to make a kind of defence.
Cries of joy arose from one side or the
other, as a wounded adversary was
carried from the field; a groan of sorrow
ascended in the air when one of
their kinsmen or comrades was hit.
Ammal&aacute;t gazed at the combat for some
time with surprise, a combat in which
there was a great deal more noise than
execution. At length he turned an
enquiring eye upon the Khan.</p>

<p>&quot;With us these are everyday affairs!&quot;
he answered, delightedly marking
each report. &quot;Such skirmishes
cherish among us a warlike spirit and
warlike habits. With you, private
quarrels end in a few blows of the dagger;
among us they become the common
business of whole villages, and any
trifle is enough to occasion them. Probably
they are fighting about some cow
that has been stolen. With us it is no
disgrace to steal in another village&mdash;the
shame is, to be found out. Admire the
coolness of our women; the balls are
whizzing about like gnats, yet they pay
no attention to them! Worthy wives
and mothers of brave men! To be
sure, there would be eternal disgrace
to him who could wound a woman,
yet no man can answer for a ball. A
sharp eye may aim it; but blind chance
carries it to the mark. But darkness
is falling from heaven, and dividing
these enemies for a moment. Let us
hasten to my kinsmen.&quot;</p>

<p>Nothing but the experience of the
Khan could have saved our travellers
from frequent falls in the precipitous
descent to the river Ouz&eacute;n. Ammal&aacute;t
could see scarcely any thing before
him; the double veil of night and
weakness enveloped his eyes; his head
turned: he beheld, as it were in a
dream, when they again mounted an
eminence, the gate and watch-tower of
the Khan's house. With an uncertain
foot he dismounted in a courtyard,
surrounded by shouting no&uacute;kers
and attendants; and he had hardly stepped
over the grated threshold when his
breath failed him&mdash;a deadly paleness
poured its snow over the wounded
man's face; and the young Bek, exhausted
by loss of blood, fatigued by
travel, hunger, and anguish of soul,
fell senseless on the embroidered carpets.</p>

<h2>CALEB STUKELY.</h2>

<h3>PART XII.</h3>

<h3>THE PARSONAGE.</h3>

<p>It was not without misgiving that
I knocked modestly at the door of
Mr Jehu Tomkins. For himself,
there was no solidity in his moral
composition, nothing to grapple or
rely upon. He was a small weak
man of no character at all, and but
for his powerful wife and active partner,
would have become the smallest
of unknown quantities in the respectable
parish that contained him. Upon
his own weak shoulders he could not
have sustained the burden of an establishment,
and must inevitably have
dwindled into the lightest of light
porters, or the most aged of errand-boys.
Nothing could have saved him
from the operation of a law, as powerful
and certain as that of gravitation,
in virtue of which the soft and
empty-headed of this world walk to
the wall, and resign, without a murmur,
their places to their betters. As
for the deaconess, I have said already
that the fact of her being a lady, and
the possessor of a heart, constituted the
only ground of hope that I could have
in reference to her. This I felt to be
insecure enough when I held the
knocker in my hand, and remembered
all at once the many little tales that I
had heard, every one of which went
far to prove that ladies may be ladies
without the generous weakness of
their sex,&mdash;and carry hearts about
with them as easily as they carry bags.</p>

<p>My first application was unsuccessful.
The deacon was not at home.
&quot;Mr Tomkins and his lady had gone
<i>to hear</i> the Reverend Doctor Whitefroth,&quot;&mdash;a
northern and eccentric
light, now blazing for a time in the
metropolis. It is a curious fact, and
worthy to be recorded, that Mr Tomkins,
and Mr Buster, and every non-conformist
whom I had hitherto encountered,
never professed to visit the
house of prayer with any other object
than that of <i>hearing</i>. It was never by
any accident to worship or to pray.
What, in truth was the vast but lowly
looking building, into which hundreds
crowded with the dapper deacon
at their head, sabbath after sabbath&mdash;what
but a temple sacred to
vanity and excitement, eloquence and
perspiration! Which one individual,
taken at random from the concourse,
was not ready to declare that his business
there that day was &quot;to hear the
dear good man,&quot; and nothing else? If
you could lay bare&mdash;as, thank Heaven,
you cannot&mdash;your fellow-creature's
heart, whither would you behold stealing
away the adoration that, in such
a place, in such a time, is due to one
alone&mdash;whither, if not to Mr Clayton?
But let this pass.</p>

<p>I paid a second visit to my friend,
and gained admittance. It was about
half-past eight o'clock in the evening,
and the shop had been closed some
twenty minutes before. I was ushered
into a well-furnished room behind
the shop, where sat the firm&mdash;Mrs
Jehu and the junior partner. The
latter looked into his lady's face, perceived
a smile upon it, and then&mdash;but
not till then, he offered me his hand,
and welcomed me with much apparent
warmth. This ceremony over, Mr
Tomkins grew fidgety and uneasy,
and betrayed a great anxiety to get
up a conversation which he had not
heart enough to set a going. Mrs
Tomkins, a woman of the world,
evinced no anxiety at all, sat smiling,
and in peace. I perceived immediately
that I must state at once the
object of my visit, and I proceeded to
the task.</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs Tomkins,&quot; I commenced.</p>

<p>&quot;Sir?&quot; said that lady, and then a
postman's knock brought us to a stop,
and Jehu skipped across the room to
listen at the door.</p>

<p>&quot;That's him, my dear Jemima,&quot; exclaimed
the linen-draper, &quot;I know his
knock,&quot; and then he skipped as quickly
to his chair again.</p>

<p>The door of the apartment was
opened by a servant girl, who entered
the room alone and approached her
mistress with a card. Mrs Tomkins
looked at it through her eye-glass,
said &quot;she was most happy,&quot; and the
servant then retired. The card was
placed upon the table near me, and,
as I believe, for my inspection. I
took it up, and read the following
<a class="pagenum" name="page315" id="page315" title="page315"></a>words, &quot;<i>Mr Stanislaus Levisohn</i>.&quot;
They were engraven in the centre of
the paper, and were surrounded by a
circle of rays, which in its turn was
enveloped in a circle of clouds. In
the very corner of the card, and in
very small characters, the words &quot;<i>general
merchant</i>&quot; were written.</p>

<p>There was a noise of shoe-cleaning
outside the door for about five minutes,
then the door was opened again by
the domestic, and a remarkable gentleman
walked very slowly in. He
was a tall individual, with small cunning
eyes, black eye-brows, and a
beard. He was rather shabbily attired,
and not washed with care. He
had thick boorish hands, and he smelt
unpleasantly of tobacco smoke; an
affected grin at variance with every
feature, was planted on his face, and
sickened an unprejudiced observer at
the very first gaze. His mode of uttering
English betrayed him for a foreigner.
He was a native of Poland.
Before uttering a syllable, the interesting
stranger walked to a corner of
the room, turned himself to the wall,
and muttered a few undistinguishable
words. He then bowed lowly to the
company, and took a chair, grinning
all the while.</p>

<p>&quot;Is that a Polish move?&quot; asked
Mr Tomkins.</p>

<p>&quot;It vos de coshtom mit de anshent
tribes, my tear sare, vor alles tings, to
recommend de family to de protection
of de hevins. Vy not now mit all
goot Christians?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why not indeed?&quot; added Mrs
Tomkins. &quot;May I offer you a glass of
raisin wine?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tank you. For de shtomack's
sake&mdash;yase.&quot;</p>

<p>A glass was poured out. It was
but decent to offer me another. I paid
my compliments to the hostess and
the gentlemen, and was about to drink
it off, when the enlightened foreigner
called upon me in a loud voice to desist.</p>

<p>&quot;Shtay, mein young friend&mdash;ve are
not de heathen and de cannibal. It
is our privilege to live in de Christian
society mit de Christian lady. Ve
most ask blessing&mdash;alvays&mdash;never forget&mdash;you
excuse&mdash;vait tree minutes.&quot;</p>

<p>It was not for me to protest against
so pious a movement, albeit it presented
itself somewhat inopportunely and
out of place. Mr Levisohn covered
his face with one hand, and murmured
a few words. The last only reached
me. It was &quot;Amen,&quot; and this was
rather heaved up in a sigh, than articulately
expressed.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you like the wine?&quot; asked
Jehu, as if he thought it superfine.</p>

<p>&quot;Yase, I like moch&mdash;especially de
sherry and de port.&quot;</p>

<p>Jehu smiled, but made no reply.</p>

<p>Mrs Tomkins supposed that port
and sherry were favourite beverages
in Poland, but, for her part, she had
found that nothing agreed so well with
British stomachs as the native wines.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah! my lady,&quot; said the Pole, &quot;ve
can give up very moch so long ve got
British religions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very true, indeed,&quot; answered Mrs
Tomkins. &quot;Pray, Mr Levisohn,
what may be your opinion of the lost
sheep? Do you think they will come
into the fold during our time?&quot;</p>

<p>Before the gentleman replies, it may
be proper to state on his behalf, that
he had never given his questioner any
reason to suppose that he was better
informed on such mysterious subjects
than herself. The history of his introduction
into the family of the linen-draper
is very short. He had been
for some years connected with Mr
Tomkins in the way of business,
having supplied that gentleman with
all the genuine foreign, but certainly
English, perfumery, that was retailed
with considerable profit in his over-nice
and pious establishment. Mrs
Tomkins, no less zealous in the cause
of the church than that of her own
shop, at length, and all on a sudden,
resolved to set about his conversion,
and to present him to the chapel as a
brand plucked with her own hand from
the burning. As a preliminary step,
he was invited to supper, and treated
with peculiar respect. The matter
was gently touched upon, but discussion
postponed until another occasion.
Mr Levisohn being very shrewd, very
needy, and enjoying no particular
principles of morality and religion,
perceived immediately the object of
his hostess, met her more than half-way
in her Christian purposes, and
accepted her numerous invitations to
tea and supper with the most affectionate
readiness. Within two months
he was received into the bosom of the
church, and became as celebrated for
the depth and intensity of his belief
as for the earnestness and promptitude
with which he attended the meetings
<a class="pagenum" name="page316" id="page316" title="page316"></a>of the brethren, particularly those in
which eating and drinking did not
constitute the least important part of
the proceedings. Being a foreigner,
he was listened to with the deepest
attention, very often indeed to his
serious annoyance, for his ignorance
was awful, and his assurance, great as
it was, not always sufficient to get him
clear of his difficulties. His foreign
accent, however, worked wonders for
him, and whenever too hard pressed,
afforded him a secure and happy retreat.
An unmeaning grin, and &quot;<i>me
not pronounce</i>,&quot; had saved him from
precipices, down which an Englishman,
<i>c&aelig;teris paribus</i>, must unquestionably
have been dashed.</p>

<p>&quot;Vill dey come?&quot; said Mr Levisohn,
in answer to the question. &quot;Yase,
certainly, if dey like, I tink.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, sir, I fear you are a latitudinarian,&quot;
said the lady.</p>

<p>&quot;I hope Hevin, my dear lady, vill
forgive me for dat, and all my wickedness.
I am a shinner, I shtink!&quot;</p>

<p>I looked at the converted gentleman,
at the same moment that Mrs Jehu
assured him that it would be a great
thing if they were all as satisfied of
their condition as he might be. &quot;Your
strong convictions of your worthlessness
is alone a proof,&quot; she added, &quot;of
your accepted state.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My lady,&quot; continued the humble
Stanislaus, &quot;I am rotten, I am a tief,
a blackguard, a swindler, a pickpocket,
a housebreak, a sticker mit de knife.
I vish somebody would call me names
all de day long, because I forget sometime
dat I am de nashty vurm of de
creation. I tink I hire a boy to call
me names, and make me not forget.
Oh, my lady, I alvays remember those
fine words you sing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>'If I could read my title clear</p>
<p class="i1">To manshions in de shkies,</p>
<p>I say farevell to every fear,</p>
<p class="i1">And vipe my veeping eyes.'&quot;</p>
</div></div>

<p>&quot;That is so conscientious of you.
Pray, my dear sir, is there an Establishment
in Poland? or have you Independent
churches?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, my dear lady, we have noting
at all!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it possible?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yase, it is possible&mdash;it is true.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who could have thought it!
What! nothing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Noting at all, my lady. Do not
ask me again, I pray you. It is
frightful to a goot Christian to talk
dese tings.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is your opinion of the Arminian
doctrine, Mr Stanislaus?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you mean de doctrine?&quot; enquired
Stanislaus, slowly, as though
he found some difficulty in answering
the question.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, my dear sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I tink,&quot; said the gentleman, after
some delay, &quot;it vould he very goot if
were not for someting.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dear me!&quot; cried Mrs Jehu, &quot;that
is so exactly my opinion!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Den dere is noting more to be
said about dat,&quot; continued Stanislaus,
interrupting her; &quot;and I hope you
vill not ask dese deep questions, my
dear lady, vich are not at all proper to
be answered, and vich put me into de
low spirits. Shall ve sing a hymn?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;By all means,&quot; exclaimed the hostess,
who immediately made preparations
for the ceremony. Hymn-books
were introduced, and the servant-maid
ordered up, and then a quartet was
performed by Mr Levisohn, Mrs Tomkins,
her husband, and Betsy. The
subject of the song was the courtship of
Isaac. Two verses only have remained
in my memory, and the manner
in which they were given out by
the fervent Stanislaus will never be
forgotten.  They ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>&quot;Ven Abraham's servant to procure</p>
<p class="i1">A vife for Isaac vent,</p>
<p>He met Rebekah, tould his vish,</p>
<p class="i1">Her parents gave conshent.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>'Shtay,' Satan, my old master, cries,</p>
<p class="i1">'Or force shall thee detain.'</p>
<p>'Hinder me not, I vill be gone,</p>
<p class="i1">I vish to break my chain.'&quot;</p>
</div></div>

<p>This being concluded, Mr Tomkins
asked Mr Levisohn what he had to
say in the business line, to which Mr
Levisohn replied, &quot;Someting very
goot, but should he not vait until after
soppare?&quot; whereupon Mr Tomkins
gave his lady a significant leer, and
the latter retired, evidently to prepare
the much desired repast. Then did
little Jehu turn confidentially to Stanislaus,
and ask him when he meant to
deliver that ere <i>conac</i> that he had
promised him so long ago.</p>

<p>&quot;Ven Providence, my tear dikkon,
paremits&mdash;I expect a case of goots at
de cushtom-house every day; but my
friend vot examins de marchandis,
and vot saves me de duties ven I
<a class="pagenum" name="page317" id="page317" title="page317"></a>makes it all right mit him, is vary ill,
I am sorry for to say, and ve most
vait, mit Christian patience, my dear
sare, till he get well. You see
dat?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes; that's clear enough. Well,
Stanny, I only hope that fellow won't
die. I don't think you'd find it so easy
to make it <i>all right</i> with any other
chap; that's all!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hope he vill not die. Ve mosht
pray dat he live, my dear dikkon. I
tink it vill be vell if der goot Mr Clayton
pray mit der church for him. You
shall speak for him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, what have you done about
the <i>Eau de Cologne</i>?&quot; continued Jehu
Tomkins. &quot;Have you nailed the fellow?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It vos specially about dis matter
dat I vish to see you, my dear sare. I
persvade der man to sell ten cases.
He be very nearly vot you call in der
mess. He valk into de Gazette next
week. He shtarve now. I pity him.
De ten cases cost him ten pounds. I
give fifty shilling&mdash;two pound ten.
He buy meat for de childs, and is
tankful. I take ten shillings for my
trouble. Der Christian satisfied mit
vary little.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Any good bills in the market,
Stanny?&quot;</p>

<p>Stanislaus Levisohn winked.</p>

<p>&quot;Ho&mdash;you don't say so,&quot; said the
deacon. &quot;Have you got 'em with you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After soppare, my dear sare,&quot;
answered Stanislaus, who looked at
me, and winked again significantly at
Jehu.</p>

<p>Mrs Tomkins returned, accompanied
by the vocal Betsy. The cloth
was spread, and real silver forks, and
fine cut tumblers, and blue plates with
scripture patterns, speedily appeared.
Then came a dish of fried sausages and
parsley&mdash;then baked potatoes&mdash;then
lamb chops. Then we all sat round
the table, and then, against all order
and propriety, Mrs Jehu grossly and
publicly insulted her husband at his
own board, by calling upon the enlightened
foreigner to ask a blessing
upon the meal.</p>

<p>The company sat down; but scarcely
were we seated before Stanislaus
resumed.</p>

<p>&quot;I tank you, my tear goot Mrs
Tomkins for dat shop mit der brown,
ven it comes to my turn to be sarved.
It look just der ting.&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs Jehu served her guest immediately.</p>

<p>&quot;I vill take a sossage, tear lady,
also, if you please.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And a baked potato?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And a baked potato? Yase.&quot;</p>

<p>He was served.</p>

<p>&quot;I beg your pardon, Christian
lady, have you got, perhaps, der littel
pickel-chesnut and der crimson cabbage?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr Tomkins, go down-stairs and
get the pickles,&quot; said the mistress of
the house, and Tomkins vanished like
a mouse on tiptoe.</p>

<p>Before he could return, Stanislaus
had eaten more than half his chop,
and discovered that, after all, &quot;it was
<i>not</i> just the ting.&quot; Mrs Jehu entreated
him to try another. He declined
at first; but at length suffered
himself to be persuaded. Four chops
had graced the dish originally; the
remaining two were divided equally
between the lady and myself. I begged
that my share might be left for
the worthy host, but receiving a recommendation
from his wife &quot;not to
mind <i>him</i>,&quot; I said no more, but kept
Mr Stanislaus Levisohn in countenance.</p>

<p>&quot;I hope you'll find it to your liking,
Mr Stukely,&quot; said our hostess.</p>

<p>&quot;Mishter vat?&quot; exclaimed the
foreigner, looking quickly up. &quot;I
tink I&quot;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;What is the matter, my dear sir?&quot;
enquired the lady of the house.</p>

<p>&quot;Noting, my tear friend, I tought
der young gentleman vos a poor unconverted
sinner dat I met a long time
ago. Dat is all. Ve talk of someting
else.&quot;</p>

<p>Has the reader forgotten the dark-visaged
individual, who at the examination
of my lamented father before
the Commissioners of Bankruptcy
made his appearance in company
with Mr Levy and the ready Ikey?
Him I mean of the vivid imagination,
who swore to facts which were no
facts at all, and whom an unpoetic
jury sentenced to vile imprisonment
for wilful perjury? <i>There he sat</i>,
transformed into a Pole, bearded and
whiskered, and the hair of his head
close clipped, but in every other regard
the same as when the constable
invited him to forsake a too prosaic
and ungrateful world: and had Mr
Levisohn been wise and guarded, the
discovery would never have been
made by me; for we had met but
once before, then only for a short half
hour, and under agitating circumstances.
<a class="pagenum" name="page318" id="page318" title="page318"></a>But my curiosity and attention
once roused by his exclamation, it
was impossible to mistake my man.
I fixed my eye upon him, and the
harder he pulled at his chop, and the
more he attempted to evade my gaze,
the more satisfied was I that a villain
and an impostor was seated amongst us.
Thinking, absurdly enough, to do my
host and hostess a lasting service, I
determined without delay to unmask
the pretended saint, and to secure his
victims from the designs he purposed.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr Levisohn,&quot; I said immediately,
&quot;you have told the truth&mdash;we
have met before.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nevare, my tear friend, you mistake;
nevare in my life, upon my vurd.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs Tomkins,&quot; I continued, rising,
&quot;I should not be worthy of your
hospitality if I did not at once make
known to you the character of that
man. He is a convicted criminal. I
have myself known him to be guilty
of the grossest practices.&quot; Mr Levisohn
dropped his chop, turned his
greasy face up, and then looked round
the room, and endeavoured to appear
unconcerned, innocent, and amazed
all at once. At this moment Jehu entered
the room with the pickles, and
the face of the deaconess grew fearfully
stern.</p>

<p>&quot;Were you ever in the Court of Bankruptcy,
Mr Levisohn?&quot; I continued.</p>

<p>&quot;I have never been out of London,
my good sare. You labour under
de mistake.&mdash;I excuse you. Ah!&quot;
he cried our suddenly, as if a new idea
had struck him very hard; &quot;I see
now vot it is. I explain. You take
me for somebody else.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not, sir. I accuse you publicly
of having committed perjury of the
most shameless kind, and I can prove
you guilty of the charge. Do you
know a person of the name of Levy?&quot;</p>

<p>Mr Stanislaus looked to the ceiling
after the manner of individuals who
desire, or who do not desire, as the
case may be, to call a subject to remembrance.
&quot;No,&quot; he answered,
after a long pause; &quot;certainly not.
I never hear dat name.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Beware of him, Mrs Tomkins,&quot;
I continued, &quot;he is an impostor, a
disgrace to mankind, and to the faith
which he professes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean by that, you
impertinent young man?&quot; said Mrs
Tomkins, her blood rising to her
face, herself rising from her chair.
&quot;I should have thought that a man
who had been so recently expelled
from his church would have had more
decency. A pretty person you must
be, to bring a charge of this kind
against so good a creature as that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, do not say dat,&quot; interposted
Stanny; &quot;I am not goot. I am a
brute beast.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr Tomkins,&quot; continued the
lady, &quot;I don't know what object that
person has in disturbing the peace of
our family, or why he comes here at
all to-night. He is a mischief-making,
hardened young man, or he would
never have come to what he has.
Well, I'm sure&mdash;What will Satan put
into his head next!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I vould vish you be not angry.
Der young gentleman is, I dare say,
vary goot at heart. He is labouring
under de deloosions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr Levisohn, pardon me, I am
not. Proofs exist, and I can bring
them to convict you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you hear that, Mr Tomkins.
Were you ever insulted so before? Are
you master in your own house?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What shall I do?&quot; said Jehu,
trembling with excitement at the door.</p>

<p>&quot;Do! What! Give him his hat,
turn him out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, my dear goot Christian friends,&quot;
said Mr Levisohn, imploringly; &quot;de
booels of der Christian growls ven
he shees dese sights; vot is de goot
of to fight? It is shtoopid. Let me
be der peacemaker. Der yong man
has been drink, perhaps. I forgive
him from te bottom of my heart. If
ve quarrel ve fight. If ve fight ve
lose every ting.</p>

</div></div>

<p>&quot;Mr Tomkins,&quot; I exclaimed, &quot;I
court inquiry, I can obtain proofs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We want none of your proofs,
you backslider,&quot; cried the deaconess.</p>

<p>&quot;Madam, you&quot;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Get out of the house, ambassador
of Satan! Mr Tomkins, will you tell
him instantly to go?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Go!&quot; squealed Tomkins from the
door, not advancing an inch.</p>

<p>I seized my hat, and left the table.</p>

<p>&quot;You will be sorry for this, sir,&quot;
said I; &quot;and you, madam&quot;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't talk to me, you bad man.
If you don't go this minute I'll spring
the rattle and have up the watchmen.&quot;</p>

<p>I did not attempt to say another
<a class="pagenum" name="page319" id="page319" title="page319"></a>word. I left the room, and hurried
from the house. I had hardly shut
the street door before it was violently
opened again, and the head of Mr
Levisohn made itself apparent.</p>

<p>&quot;Go home,&quot; exclaimed that gentleman,
&quot;and pray to be shaved, you
shtoopid ass.&quot;</p>

<p>It was not many days after the
enacting of this scene, that I entered
upon my duties as the instructor of
the infant children of my friend. It
was useless to renew my application
to the deacon, and I abandoned the
idea. The youngest of my pupils was
the lisping Billy. It was my honour
to introduce him at the very porch of
knowledge&mdash;to place him on the first
step of learning's ladder&mdash;to make familiar
to him the simple letters of his
native tongue, in whose mysterious
combinations the mighty souls of men
appear and speak. The lesson of the
alphabet was the first that I gave,
and a heavy sadness depressed and
humbled me when, as the child repeated
wonderingly after me, letter
by letter, I could not but feel deeply
and acutely the miserable blighting
of my youthful promises. How long
was it ago&mdash;it seemed but yesterday,
when the sun used to shine brightly
into my own dear bed-room, and
awake me with its first gush of light,
telling my ready fancy that he came
to rouse me from inaction, and to encourage
me to my labours. Oh, happy
labours! Beloved books! What joy
I had amongst you! The house was
silent&mdash;the city's streets tranquil as
the breath of morning. I heard nothing
but the glorious deeds ye spoke
of, and saw only the worthies that
were but dust, when centuries now
passed were yet unborn, but whose
immortal spirits are vouchsafed still
to elevate man, and cheer him onward.
How intense and sweet was
our communion; and as I read and
read on, how gratefully repose crept
over me; how difficult it seemed to
think unkindly of the world, or to believe
in all the tales of human selfishness
and cruelty with which the old
will ever mock the ear and dull the
heart of the confiding and the young.
How willing I felt to love, and how
gay a place was earth, with her constant
sun, and overflowing lap, and
her thousand joys, for man! And how
intense was the fire of <i>hope</i> that burned
within me&mdash;fed with new fuel every
passing hour, and how abiding and
how beautiful <i>the future</i>! THE FUTURE!
and it was here&mdash;a nothing&mdash;a
dream&mdash;a melancholy phantasm!</p>

<p>There are seasons of adversity, in
which the mind, plunged in despondency
and gloom, is startled and distressed
by pictures of a happier time,
that travel far to fool and tantalize
the suffering heart. I sat with the
child, and gazing full upon him, beheld
him not, but&mdash;a vision of my
father's house. There sits the good
old man, and at his side&mdash;ah, how seldom
were they apart!&mdash;my mother.
And there, too, is the clergyman, my
first instructor. Every well-remembered
piece of furniture is there. The
chair, sacred to my sire, and venerated
by me for its age, and for our long
intimacy. I have known it since
first I knew myself. The antique
bookcase&mdash;the solid chest of drawers&mdash;the
solemn sofa, all substantial as
ever, and looking, as at first, the immoveable
and natural properties of
the domestic parlour. My mother
has her eyes upon me, and they are
full of tears. My father and the minister
are building up my fortunes,
are fixing in the sandy basis of futurity
an edifice formed of glittering
words, incorporeal as the breath that
rears it. And the feelings of that hour
come back upon me. I glow with
animation, confidence, and love. I
have the strong delight that beats
within the bosom of the boy who has
the parents' trusty smile for ever on
him. I dream of pouring happiness
into those fond hearts&mdash;of growing up
to be their prop and staff in their decline.
I pierce into the future, and
behold myself the esteemed and honoured
amongst men&mdash;the patient,
well-rewarded scholar&mdash;the cherished
and the cherisher of the dear authors
of my life&mdash;all brightness&mdash;all glory&mdash;all
unsullied joy. The child touches
my wet cheek, and asks me why I
weep?&mdash;why?&mdash;why? He knows not
of the early wreck that has annihilated
the unhappy teacher's peace.</p>

<p>We were still engaged upon our
lesson, when John Thompson interrupted
the proceeding, by entering
the apartment in great haste, and
placing in my hands a newspaper.
&quot;He had been searching,&quot; he said,
&quot;for one whole fortnight, to find a
<a class="pagenum" name="page320" id="page320" title="page320"></a>situation that would suit me, and now
he thought that he had hit upon it.
There it was, 'a tutorer in a human
family,' to teach the languages and
the sciences. Apply from two to four.
It's just three now. Send the youngster
to his mother, and see after it,
my friend. I wouldn't have you lose
it for the world.&quot; I took the journal
from his hands, and, as though placed
there by the hand of the avenger to
arouse deeper remorse, to draw still
hotter blood from the lacerated heart,
the following announcement, and nothing
else, glared on the paper, and
took possession of my sight.</p>

<p>&quot;UNIVERSITY INTELLIGENCE. After
a contest more severe than any known
for years, MR JOHN SMITHSON, <i>of
Trinity College, Cambridge</i>, has been
declared THE SENIOR WRANGLER of
his year. Mr Smithson is, we understand,
the son of a humble curate
in Norfolk, whose principal support
has been derived from the exertions
of his son during his residence in the
University. The honour could not
have been conferred on a more
deserving child of Alma Mater.&quot;</p>

<p>A hundred recollections crowded
on my brain. My heart was torn with
anguish. The perseverance and the
filial piety of Smithson, so opposite
to my unsteadiness and unnatural disloyalty,
confounded and unmanned
me. I burst into tears before the faithful
Thompson, and covered my face
for very shame.</p>

<p>&quot;What is the matter, lad?&quot; exclaimed
the good fellow, pale with
surprise, his eye trembling with honest
feeling. &quot;Have I hurt you? Drat
the paper! Don't think, Stukely, I
wished to get rid of you. Don't think
so hard of your old friend. I thought
to help and do you service; I know
you have the feelings of a gentleman
about you, and I wouldn't wound 'em,
God knows, for any thing. There,
think no more about it. I am so rough
a hand, I'm not fit to live with Christians.
I mean no harm, believe me.
Get rid of you, my boy! I only wish
you'd say this is your home, and
never leave me&mdash;that would make me
happy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thompson,&quot; I answered, through
my tears, &quot;I am not deserving of
your friendship. You have not offended
me. You have never wronged
me. You are all kindness and truth.
I have had no real enemy but myself.
Read that paper.&quot;</p>

<p>I pointed to the paragraph, and he
read it.</p>

<p>&quot;What of it?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Thompson,&quot; listen to me; &quot;what
do you say of such a son?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can guess his father's feelings,&quot;
said my friend. &quot;Earth's a heaven,
Stukely, when father and child live
together as God appointed them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But when a child breaks a parent's
heart, Thompson&mdash;what then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't talk about it, lad. I have
got eleven of 'em, and that's a side of
the picture that I can't look at with
pleasure. I think the boys are good.
They have gone on well as yet; but
who can tell what a few years will
do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Or a few months, Thompson,&quot; I
answered quickly, &quot;or a few days, or
hours, when the will is fickle, principles
unfixed, and the heart treacherous
and false. That Smithson and I,
Thompson, were fellow students. We
left home together&mdash;we took up our
abode in the University together&mdash;we
were attached to the same college&mdash;taught
by the same master&mdash;read from
the same books. My feelings were
as warm as his. My resolution to do
well apparently as firm, my knowledge
and attainments as extensive. If he
was encouraged, and protected, and
urged forward by the fond love of a
devoted household&mdash;so was I. If parental
blessings hallowed his entrance
upon those pursuits which have ended
so successfully for him&mdash;so did they
mine. If he had motive for exertion,
I had not less&mdash;we were equal in the
race which we began together&mdash;look
at us now!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How did it happen, then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He was honest and faithful to his
purpose. I was not. He saw one object
far in the distance before him,
and looked neither to the right nor
left, but dug his arduous way towards
it. He craved not the false excitement
of temporary applause, nor
deemed the opinion of weak men essential
to his design. He had a sacred
duty to perform, which left him
not the choice of action, and he performed
it to the letter. He had a feeling
conscience, and a reasoning heart,
and the home of his youth, and the
sister who had grown up with him,
the father who had laboured, the mother
<a class="pagenum" name="page321" id="page321" title="page321"></a>who had striven for him, visited
him by night and by day&mdash;in his silent
study, and in his lonely bed, comforting,
animating, and supporting him
by their delightful presence.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And what did you do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just the reverse of this. I had
neither simplicity of aim, nor stability
of affection. One slip from the path,
and I hadn't energy to take the road
again. One vicious inclination, and
the virtuous resolves of years melted
before it. The sneer of a fool could
frighten me from rectitude&mdash;the smile
of a girl render me indifferent to the
pangs that tear a parent's heart.
Look at us both. Look at him&mdash;the
man whom I treated with contemptuous
derision. What a return home
for him&mdash;his mission accomplished&mdash;HIS
DUTY DONE! Look at me, the outcast,
the beggar, the despised&mdash;the
author of a mother's death, a father's
bankruptcy and ruin&mdash;with no excuse
for misconduct, no promise for the
future, no self-justification, and no
hope of pardon beyond that afforded
to the vilest criminal that comes repentant
to the mercy throne of God!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well&mdash;but, sir&mdash;Stukely&mdash;don't
take the thing to heart. You are
young&mdash;look for'rads. Oh, I tell you,
it's a blessed thing to be sorry for our
faults, and to feel as if we wished to
do better for the time to come. I'm
an older man than you, and I bid you
take comfort, and trust to God for
better things, and better things will
come, too. You are not so badly off
now as you were this time twelvemonth.
And you know I'll never
leave you. Don't despond&mdash;don't give
away. It's unnatural for a man to
do it, and he's lost if he does. Oh,
bless you, this is a life of suffering and
sorrow, and well it is; for who wouldn't
go mad to think of leaving all his
young 'uns behind him, and every
thing he loves, if he wasn't taught
that there's a quieter place above,
where all shall meet agin? You know
me, my boy; I can't talk, but I want
to comfort you and cheer you up&mdash;and
so, give me your hand, old fellow, and
say you won't think of all this any more,
but try and forget it, and see about
settling comfortably in life. What do
you say to the advertisement? A tutorer
in a human family, to teach the languages
and the sciences. Come now,
that's right; I'm glad to see you
laugh. I suppose I don't give the
right pronunciation to the words.
Well, never mind; laugh at your old
friend. He'd rather see you laugh
at him than teaze your heart about
your troubles.&quot;</p>

<p>Thompson would not be satisfied
until I had read the advertisement,
and given him my opinion of its merits.
He would not suffer me to say another
word about my past misfortunes, but
insisted on my looking forward cheerfully,
and like a man. The situation
appeared to him just the thing for me;
and after all, if I had wrangled as
well as that 'ere Smithson&mdash;(though,
at the same time, <i>wrangling</i> seemed a
very aggravating word to put into
young men's mouths at all)&mdash;perhaps
I shouldn't have been half as
happy as a quiet comfortable life
would make me. &quot;I was cut out for
a tutorer. He was sure of it. So
he'd thank me to read the paper without
another syllable.&quot; The advertisement,
in truth, was promising. &quot;The
advertiser, in London, desired to engage
the services of a young gentleman,
capable of teaching the ancient
languages, and giving his pupils 'an
introduction to the sciences.' The
salary would be liberal, and the occupation
with a humane family in the
country, who would receive the tutor
as one of themselves. References
would be required and given.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;References would be required and
given,&quot; I repeated, after having concluded
the advertisement, and put the
paper down.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, that's the only thing!&quot; said
Thompson, scratching his honest ear,
like a man perplexed and driven to a
corner. &quot;We haven't got no references
to give. But I'll tell you what we've
got though. We've got the papers
of these freehold premises, and we've
something like two thousand in the
bank. I'll give 'em them, if you
turns out a bad 'un. That I'll undertake
to do, and shan't be frightened
either. Now, you just go, and
see if you can get it. Where do you
apply?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait, Thompson. I must not
suffer you&quot;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you hear what I said, sir?
where do you apply?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At X.Y.Z.&quot; said I, &quot;in Swallow
street, Saint James's.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then, don't you lose a minute.
<a class="pagenum" name="page322" id="page322" title="page322"></a>I shouldn't be surprised if the place is
run down already. London's overstocked
with tutorers and men of larning.
You come along o' me, Billy,
and don't you lose sight of this 'ere
chance, my boy. If they wants a reference,
tell 'em I'll be glad to wait
upon 'em.&quot;</p>

<p>Three days had not elapsed after
this conversation, before my services
were accepted by X.Y.Z.&mdash;and I
had engaged to travel into Devonshire
to enter at once upon my duties, as
teacher in the dwelling-house of the
Reverend Walter Fairman. X.Y.Z.
was a man of business; and, fortunately
for me, had known my father well.
He was satisfied with my connexion,
and with the unbounded recommendation
which Thompson gave with me.
Mr Fairman was incumbent of one of
the loveliest parishes in England, and
the guardian and teacher of six boys.
My salary was fifty pounds per annum,
with board and lodging. The
matter was settled in a few hours,
and before I had time to consider, my
place was taken in the coach, and a
letter was dispatched to Mr Fairman,
announcing my intended departure.
Nothing could exceed the joy
of Thompson at my success&mdash;nothing
could be kinder and more anxious
than his valuable advice.</p>

<p>&quot;Now,&quot; he said as we walked together
from the coach-office, &quot;was I
wrong in telling you that better things
would turn up? Take care of yourself,
and the best wrangler of the lot may
be glad to change places with you. It
isn't lots of larning, or lots of money,
or lots of houses and coaches, that
makes a man happy in this world.
They never can do it; but they can do
just the contrarery, and make him
the miserablest wretch as crawls. <i>A
contented mind</i> is 'the one thing
needful.' Take what God gives
gratefully, and do unto others as you
would that they should do unto you.
That's a maxim that my poor father
was always giving me, and, I wish,
when I take the young 'uns to church,
that they could always hear it, for human
natur needs it.&quot;</p>

<p>The evening before my setting out
was spent with Thompson's family. I
had received a special invitation, and
Thompson, with the labouring sons,
were under an engagement to the
mistress of the house, to leave the
workshop at least an hour earlier than
usual. Oh, it was a sight to move
the heart of one more hardened than
I can boast to be, to behold the affectionate
party assembled to bid me
farewell, and to do honour to our
leave-taking. A little feast was prepared
for the occasion, and my many
friends were dressed, all in their Sunday
clothes, befittingly. There was
not one who had not something to
give me for a token. Mary had worked
me a purse; and Mary blushed
whilst her mother betrayed her, and
gave the little keepsake. Ellen thought
a pincushion might be useful; and
the knitter of the large establishment
provided me with comforters.
All the little fellows, down
to Billy himself, had a separate gift,
which each must offer with a kiss,
and with a word or two expressive of
his good wishes. All hoped I would
come soon again, and Aleck more than
hinted a request that I would postpone
my departure to some indefinite
period which he could not name.
Poor tremulous heart! how it throbbed
amongst them all, and how sad it
felt to part from them! Love bound
me to the happy room&mdash;the only love
that connected the poor outcast with
the wide cold world. This was the
home of my affections&mdash;could I leave
it&mdash;could I venture once more upon
the boisterous waters of life without
regret and apprehension?</p>

<p>Thompson kindly offered to accompany
me on the following morning to
the inn from which I was destined to
depart, but I would not hear of it.
He was full of business; had little
time to spare, and none to throw
away upon me. I begged him not to
think of it, and he acquiesced in my
wishes. We were sitting together,
and his wife and children had an hour
or two previously retired to rest.</p>

<p>&quot;Them's good children, ain't they,
Stukely?&quot; enquired Thompson, after
having made a long pause.</p>

<p>&quot;You may well be proud of them,&quot;
I answered.</p>

<p>&quot;It looked nice of 'em to make you
a little present of something before
you went. But it was quite right.
That's just as it should be. I like
that sort of thing, especially when a
man understands the sperrit that a
thing's given with. Now, some fellows
would have been offended if any
<a class="pagenum" name="page323" id="page323" title="page323"></a>thing had been offered 'em. How I
do hate all that!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I assure you, Thompson, I feel
deeply their kind treatment of their
friend. I shall never forget it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You ain't offended, then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, indeed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, now, I am so happy to hear
it, you can't think,&quot; continued Thompson,
fumbling about his breeches
pocket, and drawing from it at length
something which he concealed in his
fist. &quot;There, take that,&quot; he suddenly
exclaimed; &quot;take it, my old fellow,
and God bless you. It's no good
trying to make a fuss about it.&quot;</p>

<p>I held a purse of money in my
hand.</p>

<p>&quot;No, Thompson,&quot; I replied, &quot;I
cannot accept it. Do not think me
proud or ungrateful; but I have no
right to take it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's only twenty guineas, man,
and I can afford it. Now look, Stukely,
you are going to leave me. If you
don't take it, you'll make me as
wretched as the day is long. You
are my friend, and my friend mustn't
go amongst strangers without an independent
spirit. If you have twenty
guineas in your pocket, you needn't
be worrying yourself about little things.
You'll find plenty of ways to make the
money useful. You shall pay me, if
you like, when you grow rich, and we
meets again; but take it now, and make
John Thompson happy.&quot;</p>

<p>In the lap of nature the troubled
mind gets rest; and the wounds of
the heart heal rapidly, once delivered
there, safe from contact with the infectious
world; and the bosom of the
nursing mother is not more powerful
or quick to lull the pain and still the
sobs of her distressed ones. It is the
sanctuary of the bruised spirit, and to
arrive at it is to secure shelter and to
find repose. Peace, eternal and blessed,
birthright and joy of angels,
whither do those glimpses hover that
we catch of thee in this tumultuous
life, weak, faint, and transient though
they be, melting the human soul with
heavenly tranquillity? Whither, if
not upon the everlasting hills, where
the brown line divides the sky, or on
the gentle sea, where sea and sky are
one&mdash;a liquid cupola&mdash;or in the leafy
woods and secret vales, where beauty
lends her thrilling voice to silence?
How often will the remembrance only
of one bright spot&mdash;a vision of Paradise
rising over the dull waste of my
existence&mdash;send a glow of comfort to
my aged heart, and a fresh feeling of
repose which the harsh business of
life cannot extinguish or disturb!
And what a fair history comes with
that shadowy recollection! How much
of passionate condensed existence is
involved in it, and how mysteriously,
yet naturally connected with it, seem
all the noblest feelings of my imperfect
nature! The scene of beauty has
become &quot;a joy for ever.&quot;</p>

<p>I recall a spring day&mdash;a sparkling
day of the season of youth and promise&mdash;and
a nook of earth, fit for the
wild unshackled sun to skip along and
brighten with his inconstant giddy
light. Hope is everywhere; murmuring
in the brooks, and smiling in
the sky. Upon the bursting trees she
sits; she nestles in the hedges. She
fills the throat of mating birds, and
bears the soaring lark nearer and
nearer to the gate of Heaven. It is
the first holiday of the year, and the
universal heart is glad. Grief and
apprehension cannot dwell in the human
breast on such a day; and, for an
hour, even <i>Self</i> is merged in the general
joy. I reach my destination;
and the regrets for the past, and the
fear for the future, which have accompanied
me through the long and
anxious journey, fall from the oppressed
spirit, and leave it buoyant,
cheerful, free&mdash;free to delight itself
in a land of enchantment, and to revel
again in the unsubstantial glories of
a youthful dream. I paint the Future
in the colours that surround me, and
I confide in her again.</p>

<p>It was noon when we reached the
headquarters of the straggling parish
of Deerhurst&mdash;its chief village. We
had travelled since the golden sunrise
over noble earth, and amongst
scenes scarcely less heavenly than the
blue vault which smiled upon them.
Now the horizon was bounded by a
range of lofty hills linked to each
other by gentle undulations, and bearing
to their summits innumerable and
giant trees; these, crowded together,
and swayed by the brisk wind, presented
to the eye the figure of a vast
and supernatural sea, and made the
intervening vale of loveliness a neglected
blank. Then we emerged
suddenly&mdash;yes, instantaneously&mdash;as
<a class="pagenum" name="page324" id="page324" title="page324"></a>though designing nature, with purpose
to surprize, had hid behind the jutting
crag, beneath the rugged steep&mdash;upon
a world of beauty; garden upon garden,
sward upon sward, hamlet upon
hamlet, far as the sight could reach,
and purple shades of all beyond.
Then, flashes of the broad ocean, like
quick transitory bursts of light, started
at intervals, washing the feet of a
tall emerald cliff, or, like a lake,
buried between the hills. Shorter
and shorter become the intermissions,
larger and larger grows the watery
expanse, until, at length, the mighty
element rolls unobstructed on, and
earth, decked in her verdant leaves,
her flowers and gems, is on the shore
to greet her.</p>

<p>The entrance to the village is by a
swift, precipitous descent. On either
side are piled rude stones, placed there
by a subtle hand, and with a poet's
aim, to touch the fancy, and to soothe
the traveller with thoughts of other
times&mdash;of ruined castles, and of old
terrace walks. Already have the
stones fulfilled their purpose, and the
ivy, the brier, and the saxifrage have
found a home amongst them. At the
foot of the declivity, standing like a
watchful mother, is the church&mdash;the
small, the unpretending, the venerable
and lovely village church. You do
not see a house till she is passed. Before
a house was built about her, she
was an aged church, and her favoured
graves were rich in heavenly clay.
The churchyard gate; and then at
once, the limited and quiet village,
nestling in a valley and shut out from
the world: beautiful and self-sufficient.
Hill upon hill behind, each greener
than the last&mdash;hill upon hill before,
all exclusion, and nothing but her
own surpassing loveliness to console
and cheer her solitude. And is it not
enough? What if she know little of
the sea beyond its voice, and nothing
of external life&mdash;her crystal stream,
her myrtle-covered cottages, her garden
plots, her variegated flowers and
massive foliage, her shady dells and
scented lanes are joys enough for her
small commonwealth. Thin curling
smoke that rises like a spirit from
the hidden bosom of one green hillock,
proclaims the single house that
has its seat upon the eminence. It is
the parsonage&mdash;my future home.</p>

<p>With a trembling heart I left the
little inn, and took my silent way to
the incumbent's house. There was
no eye to follow me, the leafy street
was tenantless, and seemed made over
to the restless sun and dissolute winds
to wanton through it as they pleased.
As I ascended, the view enlarged&mdash;beauty
became more beauteous, silence
more profound. I reached the
parsonage gate, and my heart yearned
to tell how much I longed to live and
die on this sequestered and most peaceful
spot. The dwelling-house was
primitive and low; its long and overhanging
roof was thatched; its windows
small and many. A myrtle,
luxuriant as a vine, covered its entire
front, and concealed the ancient brick
and wood. A raised bank surrounded
the green nest, and a gentle slope conducted
to a lawn fringed with the earliest
flowers of the year. I rang the
loud bell, and a neatly dressed servant-girl
gave me admittance to the
house. In a room of moderate size,
furnished by a hand as old at least as
the grandsires of the present occupants,
and well supplied with books,
sat the incumbent. He was a man of
fifty years of age or more, tall and
gentlemanly in demeanour. His head
was partly bald, and what remained of
his hair was grey almost to whiteness.
He had a noble forehead, a marked
brow, and a cold grey eye. His
mouth betrayed sorrow, or habitual
deep reflection, and the expression of
every other feature tended to seriousness.
The first impression was unfavourable.
A youth, who was reading
with the minister when I entered
the apartment, was dismissed with a
simple inclination of the head, and the
Rev. Walter Fairman then pointed to
a seat.</p>

<p>&quot;You have had a tedious journey,
Mr Stukely,&quot; began the incumbent,
&quot;and you are fatigued, no doubt.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What a glorious spot this is, sir!&quot;
I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it is pretty,&quot; answered Mr
Fairman, very coldly as I thought.
&quot;Are you hungry, Mr Stukely? We
dine early; but pray take refreshment
if you need it.&quot;</p>

<p>I declined respectfully.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you bring letters from my
agent?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have a parcel in my trunk, sir,
which will be here immediately.
What magnificent trees!&quot; I exclaimed
<a class="pagenum" name="page325" id="page325" title="page325"></a>again, my eyes riveted upon a stately
cluster, which were about a hundred
yards distant.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you been accustomed to
tuition?&quot; asked Mr Fairman, taking
no notice of my remark.</p>

<p>&quot;I have not, sir, but I am sure
that I shall be delighted with the
occupation. I have always thought
so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We must not be too sanguine.
Nothing requires more delicate handling
than the mind of youth. In no
business is experience, great discernment
and tact, so much needed as in
that of instruction.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir, I am aware of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No doubt,&quot; answered Mr Fairman
quietly. &quot;How old are you?&quot;</p>

<p>I told my age, and blushed.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, well,&quot; said the incumbent,
&quot;I have no doubt we shall do. You
are a Cambridge man, Mr Graham
writes me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was only a year, sir, at the university.
Circumstances prevented a
longer residence. I believe I mentioned
the fact to Mr Graham.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yes, he told me so. You
shall see the boys this afternoon. They
are fine-hearted lads, and much may
be done with them. There are six.
Two of them are pretty well advanced.
They read Euripides and
Horace. Is Euripides a favourite of
yours?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is tender, plaintive, and passionate,&quot;
I answered; &quot;but perhaps I
may be pardoned if I venture to prefer
the vigour and majesty of the sterner
tragedian.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You mean you like &AElig;schylus
better. Do you write poetry, Mr
Stukely? Not Latin verses, but English
poetry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I am glad of that. It
struck me that you did. Will you
really take no refreshment? Are you
not fatigued?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not in the least, sir. This lovely
prospect, for one who has seen so little
of nature as I have, is refreshment
enough for the present.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; said Mr Fairman, sighing
faintly, &quot;you will get accustomed to
it. There is something in the prospect,
but more in your own mind.
Some of our poor fellows would be
easily served and satisfied, if we could
feed them on the prospect. But if
you are not tired you shall see more
of it if you will. I have to go down
to the village. We have an hour
till dinner-time. Will you accompany
me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;With pleasure, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very well.&quot; Mr Fairman then rang
the bell, and the servant girl came in.</p>

<p>&quot;Where's Miss Ellen, Mary?&quot;
asked the incumbent.</p>

<p>&quot;She has been in the village since
breakfast, sir. Mrs Barnes sent word
that she was ill, and Miss took her the
rice and sago that Dr Mayhew ordered.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Has Warden been this morning?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Foolish fellow. I'll call on him.
Mary, if Cuthbert the fisherman
comes, give him that bottle of port
wine; but tell him not to touch a drop
of it himself. It is for his sick child,
and it is committing robbery to take
it. Let him have the blanket also
that was looked out for him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's gone, sir. Miss sent it yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very well. There is nothing
more. Now, Mr Stukely, we will go.&quot;</p>

<p>I have said already that the first
opinion which I formed of the disposition
of Mr Fairman was not a flattering
one. Before he spoke a word,
I felt disappointed and depressed.
My impression after our short conversation
was worse than the first.
The natural effect of the scene
in which I suddenly found myself,
had been to prepare my ever too
forward spirit for a man of enthusiasm
and poetic temperament. Mr
Fairman was many degrees removed
from warmth. He spoke to me in
a sharp tone of voice, and sometimes,
I suspected, with the intention
of mocking me. His <i>manner</i>, when
he addressed the servant-girl, was not
more pleasing. When I followed him
from the room, I regretted the haste
with which I had accepted my appointment;
but a moment afterwards
I entered into fairyland again, and
the passing shadow left me grateful
to Providence for so much real enjoyment.
We descended the hill,
and for a time, in silence, Mr Fairman
was evidently engaged in deep
thought, and I had no wish to disturb
him. Every now and then we lighted
upon a view of especial beauty, and I
was on the point of expressing my unbounded
<a class="pagenum" name="page326" id="page326" title="page326"></a>admiration, when one look at
my cool and matter-of-fact companion
at once annoyed and stopped me.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Mr Fairman at length,
still musing. &quot;It is very difficult&mdash;very
difficult to manage the poor. I
wonder if they are grateful at heart.
What do you think, Mr Stukely?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have nothing to say of the poor,
sir, but praise.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr Fairman looked hard at me, and
smiled unpleasantly.</p>

<p>&quot;It is the scenery, I suppose. That
will make you praise every thing for
the next day or so. It will not do,
though. We must walk on our feet,
and be prosaic in this world. The
poor are not as poets paint them, nor
is there so much happiness in a hovel
as they would lead you to expect. The
poets are like you&mdash;they have nothing
to say but praise. Ah, me! they draw
largely on their imaginations.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not, sir, in this instance,&quot;
I answered, somewhat nettled. &quot;My
most valued friends are in the humblest
ranks of life. I am proud to say
so. I am not prepared to add, that
the most generous of men are the most
needy, although it has been my lot to
meet with sympathy and succour at
the hands of those who were much in
want of both themselves.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I believe you, Mr Stukely,&quot; answered
the incumbent in a more feeling
tone. &quot;I am not fond of theories;
yet that's a theory with which I would
willingly pass through life; but it will
not answer. It is knocked on the head
every hour of the day. Perhaps it is
our own fault. We do not know how
to reach the hearts, and educate the
feelings of the ignorant and helpless.
Just step in here.&quot;</p>

<p>We were standing before a hut at
the base of the hill. It was a low
dirty-looking place, all roof, with a
neglected garden surrounding it. One
window was in the cob-wall. It had
been fixed there originally, doubtless
with the object of affording light to
the inmates; but light, not being essential
to the comfort or happiness of the
present tenants, was in a great measure
excluded by a number of small
rags which occupied the place of the
diamond panes that had departed
many months before. A child, ill-clad,
in fragments of clothes, with
long and dirty hair, unclean face, and
naked feet, cried at the door, and loud
talking was heard within. Mr Fairman
knocked with his knuckle before he
entered, and a gruff voice desired him to
&quot;come in.&quot; A stout fellow, with a
surly countenance and unshaven beard,
was sitting over an apology for a fire,
and a female of the same age and condition
was near him. She bore an
unhappy infant in her arms, whose
melancholy peakish face, not twelve-months
old, looked already conscious
of prevailing misery. There was no
flooring to the room, which contained
no one perfect or complete article of
furniture, but symptoms of many,
from the blanketless bed down to the
solitary coverless saucepan. Need I
add, that the man who sat there, the
degraded father of the house, had his
measure of liquor before him, and
that the means of purchasing it were
never wanting, however impudently
charity might be called upon to supply
the starving family with bread?</p>

<p>The man did not rise upon our entrance.
He changed colour very
slightly, and looked more ignorantly
surly, or tried to do so.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Jacob Warden,&quot; said the
incumbent, &quot;you are determined to
brave it out, I see.&quot; The fellow did
not answer.</p>

<p>&quot;When I told you yesterday that
your idleness and bad habits were
bringing you to ruin, you answered&mdash;<i>I
was a liar</i>. I then said, that when
you were sorry for having uttered
that expression, you might come to
the parsonage and tell me so. You
have not been yet&mdash;I am grieved to
say it. What have I ever done to you,
Jacob Warden, that you should behave
so wickedly? I do not wish you
to humble yourself to me, but I should
have been glad to see you do your
duty. If I did mine, perhaps, I should
give you up, and see you no more, for
I fear you are a hardened man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He hasn't had no work for a
month,&quot; said the wife, in a tone of upbraiding,
as if the minister had been
the wilful cause of it.</p>

<p>&quot;And whose fault is that, Mrs
Warden? There is work enough for
sober and honest men in the parish.
Why was your husband turned away
from the Squire's?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, all along of them spoons.
They never could prove it agin him,
that's one thing&mdash;though they tried it
hard enough.&quot;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page327" id="page327" title="page327"></a>&quot;Come, come, Mrs Warden, if
you love that man, take the right
way to show it. Think of your children.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; if I didn't&mdash;who would, I
should like to know? The poor are
trodden under foot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not so, Mrs Warden, the poor
are taken care of, if they are deserving.
God loves the poor, and commands
us all to love them. Give me
your Bible?&quot; The woman hesitated a
minute, and then answered&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Never mind the Bible, that won't
get us bread.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Give me your Bible, Mrs Warden.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We have'nt got it. What's the
use of keeping a Bible in the house for
children as can't read, when they are
crying for summat to eat?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have sold it, then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We got a shilling on it&mdash;that's all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have you ever applied to us for
food, and has it been denied you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I don't know. The servant
always looks grumpy at us when we
come a-begging, and seems to begrudge
us every mouthful. It's all very well
to live on other persons' leavings. I
dare say you don't give us what you
could eat yourselves.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We give the best we can afford,
Mrs Warden, and, God knows, with
no such feeling as you suppose. How
is the child? Is it better?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, no thanks to Doctor Mayhew
either.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did he not call, then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Call! Yes, but he made me tramp
to his house for the physic, and when
he passed the cottage the other day, I
called after him; but devil a bit would
he come back. We might have died
first, of course: he knows, he isn't paid,
and what does he care?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is very wrong of you to talk so.
You are well aware that he was hurrying
to a case of urgency, and could
not be detained. He visited you upon
the following day, and told you so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yes, the following day!
What's that to do with it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Woman&quot; exclaimed Mr Fairman,
solemnly, &quot;my heart bleeds for those
poor children. What will become of
them with such an example before
their eyes? I can say no more to
you than I have repeated a hundred
times before. I would make you
happy in this world if I could; I
would save you. You forbid me. I
would be your true friend, and you
look upon me as an enemy. Heaven,
I trust, will melt your heart! What
is that child screaming for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What! she hasn't had a blessed
thing to-day. We had nothing for her.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr Fairman took some biscuits from
his pockets, and placed them on the
table. &quot;Let the girl come in, and
eat,&quot; said he. &quot;I shall send you some
meat from the village. Warden, I
cannot tell you how deeply I feel
your wickedness. I did expect you to
come to the parsonage and say you
were sorry. It would have looked
well, and I should have liked it. You
put it out of my power to help you.
It is most distressing to see you both
going headlong to destruction. May
you live to repent! I shall see you
again this evening, and I will speak
to you alone. Come, Mr Stukely,
our time is getting short.&quot;</p>

<p>The incumbent spoke rapidly, and
seemed affected. I looked at him, and
could hardly believe him to be the
cold and unimpassioned man that I
had at first imagined him.</p>

<p>We pursued our way towards the
village.</p>

<p>&quot;There, sir,&quot; said the minister in a
quick tone of voice, &quot;what is the
beautiful prospect, and what are the
noble trees, to the heart of that man?
What have they to do at all with
man's morality? Had those people
never seen a shrub or flower, could
they have been more impenetrable,
more insolent and suspicious, or
steeped in vice much deeper? That
man wants only opportunity, a large
sphere of action, and the variety of
crime and motive that are to be found
amongst congregated masses of mankind,
to become a monster. His passions
and his vices are as wilful and
as strong as those of any man born
and bred in the sinks of a great city.
They have fewer outlets, less capability
of mischief&mdash;and there is the difference.&quot;</p>

<p>I ventured no remark, and the incumbent,
after a short pause, continued
in a milder strain.</p>

<p>&quot;I may be, after all, weak and inefficient.
Doubtless great delicacy and
caution are required. Heavenly
truths are not to be administered to
these as to the refined and willing.
The land must be ploughed, or it is
useless to sow the seed. Am I not
perhaps, an unskilful labourer?&quot;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page328" id="page328" title="page328"></a>Mr Fairman stopped at the first
house in the village&mdash;the prettiest of
the half dozen myrtle-covered cottages
before alluded to. Here he
tapped softly, and a gentle foot that
seemed to know the visitor hastened
to admit him.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Mary,&quot; said the minister,
glancing round the room&mdash;a clean
and happy-looking room it was&mdash;&quot;where's
Michael?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is gone, sir, as you bade him,
to make it up with Cousin Willett.
He couldn't rest easy, sir, since you
told him that it was no use coming to
church so long as he bore malice. He
won't be long, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr Fairman smiled; and cold as his
grey eye might be, it did not seem so
steady now.</p>

<p>&quot;Mary, that is good of him; tell
him his minister is pleased. How is
work with him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He has enough to do, to carry
him to the month's end, sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then at the month's end, Mary,
let him come to the parsonage. I
have something for him there. But
we can wait till then. Have you seen
the itinerary preacher since?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is not his time, sir. He
didn't promise to come till Monday
week.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do neither you nor Michael speak
with him, nor listen to his public
preachings. I mean, regard him not
as one having authority. I speak solemnly,
and with a view to your eternal
peace. Do not forget.&quot;</p>

<p>Every house was visited, and in all,
opportunity was found for the exercise
of the benevolent feelings by
which the incumbent was manifestly
actuated. He lost no occasion of affording
his flock sound instruction and
good advice. It could not be doubted
for an instant that their real welfare,
temporal and everlasting, lay
deeply in his heart. I was struck by
one distinguishing feature in his mode
of dealing with his people; it was so
opposed to the doctrine and practice
of Mr Clayton, and of those who were
connected with him. With the latter,
a certain degree of physical fervour,
and a conventional peculiarity
of expression, were insisted upon and
accepted as evidences of grace and renewed
life. With Mr Fairman, neither
acquired heat, nor the more easily
acquired jargon of a clique, were
taken into account. He rather repressed
than encouraged their existence;
but he was desirous, and even
eager, to establish rectitude of conduct
and purity of feeling in the disciples
around him: these were to him
tangible witnesses of the operation of
that celestial Spirit before whose light
the mists of simulation and deceit fade
unresistingly away. I could not help
remarking, however, that in every
cottage the same injunction was given
in respect of the itinerant; the same
solemnity of manner accompanied the
command; the same importance was
attached to its obedience. There
seemed to me, fresh from the hands
of Mr Clayton, something of bigotry
and uncharitableness in all this. I
did not hint at this effect upon my
own mind, nor did I inquire into the
motives of the minister. I was not
pleased; but I said nothing. As if
Mr Fairman read my very thoughts,
he addressed me on the subject almost
before the door of the last cottage was
closed upon us.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Bigoted</i> and <i>narrow-minded,</i> are
the terms, Mr Stukely, by which the
extremely liberal would characterize
the line of conduct which I am compelled
by duty to pursue. I cannot
be frightened by harsh terms. I am
the pastor of these people, and must
decide and act for them. I am their
shepherd, and must be faithful. Poor
and ignorant, and unripe in judgment,
and easily deceived by the shows and
counterfeits of truth as the ignorant
are, is it for me to hand them over to
perplexity and risk? They are simple
believers, and are contented. They
worship God, and are at peace. They
know their lot, and do not murmur at
it. Is it right that they should be
disturbed with the religious differences
and theological subtleties which
have already divided into innumerable
sects the universal family of Christians
whom God made one? Is it fair
or merciful to whisper into their ears
the plausible reasons of dissatisfaction,
envy, and complaining, to which the
uninformed of all classes but too eagerly
listen? I have ever found the
religious and the political propagandist
united in the same individual.
The man who proposes to the simple
to improve his creed, is ready
to point out the way to better his condition.
He succeeds in rendering
him unhappy in both, and there he
leaves him. So would this man, and
<a class="pagenum" name="page329" id="page329" title="page329"></a>I would rather die for my people,
than tamely give them over to their
misery.&quot;</p>

<p>A tall, stout, weather-beaten man,
in the coarse dress of a fisherman, descending
the hill, intercepted our way.
It was the man Cuthbert, already
mentioned by Mr Fairman. He
touched his southwester to the incumbent.</p>

<p>&quot;How is the boy, Cuthbert?&quot; asked
the minister, stopping at the same
moment.</p>

<p>&quot;All but well, sir. Doctor Mayhew
don't mean to come again. It's
all along of them nourishments that
Miss Ellen sent us down. The Doctor
says he must have died without
them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Cuthbert, I trust that we
shall find you grateful.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Grateful, sir!&quot; exclaimed the
man. &quot;If ever I forget what you
have done for that poor child, I hope
the breath&mdash;&mdash;&quot; The brawny fisherman
could say no more. His eyes
filled suddenly with tears, and he held
down his head, ashamed of them. He
had no cause to be so.</p>

<p>&quot;Be honest and industrious, Cuthbert;
give that boy a good example.
Teach him to love his God, and his
neighbour as himself. That will be
gratitude enough, and more than pay
Miss Ellen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll try to do it, sir. God bless you!&quot;</p>

<p>We said little till we reached the
parsonage again; but before I re-entered
its gate the Reverend Walter
Fairman had risen in my esteem, and
ceased to be considered a cold and
unfeeling man.</p>

<p>We dined; the party consisting of
the incumbent, the six students, and
myself. The daughter, the only
daughter and child of Mr Fairman,
who was himself a widower, had not
returned from the cottage to which
she had been called in the morning.
It was necessary that a female should
be in constant attendance upon the
aged invalid; a messenger had been
despatched to the neighbouring village
for an experienced nurse; and
until her arrival Miss Fairman would
permit no one but herself to undertake
the duties of the sick chamber.
It was on this account that we were
deprived of the pleasure of her society,
for her accustomed seat was at the
head of her father's table. I was
pleased with the pupils. They were
affable and well-bred. They treated
the incumbent with marked respect,
and behaved towards their new teacher
with the generous kindness and freedom
of true young gentlemen. The
two eldest boys might be fifteen years
of age. The remaining four could
not have reached their thirteenth year.
In the afternoon I had the scholars to
myself. The incumbent retired to his
library, and left us to pass our first
day in removing the restraint that was
the natural accompaniment of our different
positions, and in securing our
intimacy. I talked of the scenery, and
found willing listeners. They understood
me better than their master, for
they were worshippers themselves.
They promised to show me lovelier
spots than any I had met with yet; sacred
corners, known only to themselves,
down by the sea, where the arbute
and laurustinus grew like trees, and
children of the ocean. Then there were
villages near, more beautiful even than
their own; one that lay in the lap of a
large hill, with the sea creeping round,
or rolling at its feet like thunder,
sometimes. What lanes, too, Miss
Fairman knew of! She would take
me into places worth the looking at;
and oh, what drawings she had made
from them! Their sisters had bought
drawings, and paid very dearly for
them too, that were not half so finely
done! They would ask her to show
me her portfolio, and she would do it
directly, for she was the kindest creature
living. It was not the worst
trait in the disposition of these boys,
that, whatever might be the subject of
conversation, or from whatever point
we might start in our discourse, they
found pleasure in making all things
bear towards the honour and renown
of their young mistress. The scenery
was nothing without Miss Fairman
and her sketches. The house was
dull without her, and the singing in
the church, if she were ill and absent,
was as different as could be. There
were the sweetest birds that could be,
heard warbling in the high trees that
lined the narrow roads; but at Miss
Fairman's window there was a nightingale
that beat them all. The day
wore on, and I did not see the general
favourite. It was dusk when she
reached the parsonage, and then she
retired immediately to rest, tired from
the labours of the day. The friend
of the family, Doctor Mayhew, had
<a class="pagenum" name="page330" id="page330" title="page330"></a>accompanied Miss Fairman home;
he remained with the incumbent, and
I continued with my young companions
until their bedtime. They departed,
leaving me their books, and
then I took a survey of the work that
was before me. My duties were to
commence on the following day, and
our first subject was the tragedy of
<i>Hecuba</i>. How very grateful did I
feel for the sound instruction which I
had received in early life from my revered
pains-taking tutor, for the solid
groundwork that he had established,
and for the rational mode of tuition
which he had from the first adopted.
From the moment that he undertook
to cultivate and inform the youthful
intellect, this became itself an active
instrument in the attainment of
knowledge&mdash;not, as is so often the
case, the mere idle depositary of encumbering
<i>words</i>. It was little that
he required to be gained by rote, for
he regarded all acquisitions as useless
in which the understanding had not
the chiefest share. He was pleased
to communicate facts, and anxious to
discover, from examination, that the
principles which they contained had
been accurately seen and understood.
Then no labour and perseverance on
his part were deemed too great for
his pupil, and the business of his life
became his first pleasure. In the
study of Greek, for which at an early
age I evinced great aptitude, I learnt
the structure of the language and its
laws from the keen observations of
my master, whose rules were drawn
from the classic work before us&mdash;rather
than from grammars. To this
hour I retain the information thus
obtained, and at no period of my life
have I ever had greater cause for
thankfulness, than when, after many
months of idleness and neglect, with a
view to purchase bread I opened, not
without anxiety, my book again, and
found that time had not impaired
my knowledge, and that light shone
brightly on the pages, as it did of old.
Towards the close of the evening, I
was invited to the study of Mr Fairman.
Doctor Mayhew was still with
him, and I was introduced to the physician
as the teacher newly arrived
from London. The doctor was a
stout good-humoured gentleman of
the middle height, with a cheerful
and healthy-looking countenance.
He was, in truth, a jovial man, as
well as a great snuff-taker. The incumbent
offered me a chair, and placed
a decanter of wine before me. His
own glass of port was untouched,
and he looked serious and dejected.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, sir, how does London
look?&quot; enquired the doctor, &quot;are
the folks as mad as they used to be?
What new invention is the rage now?
What bubble is going to burst? What
lord committed forgery last? Who
was the last woman murdered before
you started?&quot;</p>

<p>I confessed my inability to answer.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, never mind. There isn't
much lost. I am almost ashamed of
old England, that's the truth on't. I
have given over reading the newspapers,
for they are about as full of
horrors as Miss What's-her-name's
tales of the Infernals. What an age
this is! all crime and fanaticism!
Everyman and everything is on the
rush. Come, Fairman, take your wine.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr Fairman sat gazing on the fire,
quietly, and took no notice of the request.
&quot;People's heads,&quot; continued
the medical gentleman, &quot;seem
turned topsy-turvy. Dear me, how
different it was in my time! What
men are about, I can't think. The
very last newspaper I read had an
advertisement that I should as soon
have expected to see there when my
father was alive, as a ship sailing
along this coast keel upwards. You
saw it, Fairman. It was just under
the Everlasting Life Pill advertisement;
and announced that the Reverend
Mr Somebody would preach
on the Sunday following, at some conventicle,
when the public were invited
to listen to him&mdash;and that the doors
would be opened half an hour earlier
than usual to prevent squeezing.
That's modern religion, and it looks
as much like ancient play-acting as
two peas. Where will these marching
days of improvement bring us to
at last?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me, Mayhew,&quot; said Mr
Fairman, &quot;does it not surprise you
that a girl of her age should be so
easily fatigued?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My dear friend, that makes the
sixth time of asking. Let us hope
that it will be the last. I don't know
what you mean by '<i>so easily</i>' fatigued.
The poor girl has been in the village
all day, fomenting and poulticing old
Mrs Barnes, and if it had been any
girl but herself, she would have been
tired out long before. Make your
mind easy. I have sent the naughty
puss to bed, and she'll be as fresh as a
rose in the morning.&quot;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page331" id="page331" title="page331"></a>&quot;She must keep her exertions within
proper bounds,&quot; continued the incumbent.
&quot;I am sure she has not
strength enough to carry out her
good intentions. I have watched her
narrowly, and cannot be mistaken.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You do wrong, then, Fairman.
Anxious watching creates fear, without
the shadow of an excuse for it.
When we have anything like a bad
symptom, it is time to get uneasy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, but what do you call a bad
symptom, Doctor?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, I call your worrying yourself
into fidgets, and teazing me into
an ill temper, a shocking symptom of
bad behaviour. If it continue, you
must take a doze. Come, my friend,
let me prescribe that glass of good
old port. It does credit to the cloth.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Seriously, Mayhew, have you
never noticed the short, hacking cough
that sometimes troubles her?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; I noticed it last January for
the space of one week, when there
was not a person within ten miles of
you who was not either hacking, as
you call it, or blowing his nose from
morning till night. The dear child
had a cold, and so had you, and I, and
everybody else.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And that sudden flush, too?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, you'll be complaining of the
bloom on the peach next! That's
health, and nothing else, take my
word for it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am, perhaps, morbidly apprehensive;
but I cannot forget her poor
mother. You attended her, Mayhew,
and you know how suddenly that
came upon us. Poor Ellen! what
should I do without her!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fairman, join me in wishing success
to our young friend here. Mr
Stukely, here's your good health; and
success and happiness attend you.
You'll find little society here; but it
is of the right sort, I can tell you.
You must make yourself at home.&quot;
The minister became more cheerful,
and an hour passed in pleasant conversation.
At ten o'clock, the horse
of Doctor Mayhew was brought to the
gate, and the gentleman departed in
great good-humour. Almost immediately
afterwards, the incumbent
himself conducted me to my sleeping
apartment, and I was not loth to get
my rest. I fell asleep with the beautiful
village floating before my weary
eyes, and the first day of my residence
at the parsonage closed peacefully
upon me.</p>

<p>It was at the breakfast table on the
succeeding morning that I beheld the
daughter of the incumbent, the favourite
and companion of my pupils, and
mistress of the house&mdash;a maiden in
her twentieth year. She was simply
and artlessly attired, gentle and retiring
in demeanour, and femininely
sweet rather than beautiful in expression.
Her figure was slender, her
voice soft and musical; her hair light
brown, and worn plain across a forehead
white as marble. The eye-brows
which arched the small, rich, hazel
eyes were delicately drawn, and the
slightly aquiline nose might have
formed a study for an artist. With
the exception, however, of this last-named
feature, there was little in the
individual lineaments of the face to
surprise or rivet the observer. Extreme
simplicity, and perfect innocence&mdash;these
were stamped upon the
countenance, and were its charm. It
was a strange feeling that possessed
me when I first gazed upon her through
the chaste atmosphere that dwelt
around her. It was degradation deep
and unaffected&mdash;a sense of shame and
undeservedness. I remembered with
self-abhorrence the relation that had
existed between the unhappy Emma
and myself, and the enormity and
disgrace of my offence never looked
so great as now, and here&mdash;in the
bright presence of unconscious purity.
She reassured and welcomed me with
a natural smile, and pursued her occupation
with quiet cheerfulness and
unconstraint. I did not wonder that
her father loved her, and entertained
the thought of losing her with fear;
for, young and gentle as she was, she
evinced wisdom and age in her deep
sense of duty, and in the government
of her happy home. Method and
order waited on her doings, and sweetness
and tranquillity&mdash;the ease and
dignity of a matron elevating and
upholding the maiden's native modesty.
And did she not love her sire
as ardently? Yes, if her virgin soul
spoke faithfully in every movement of
her guileless face. Yes, if there be
truth in tones that strike the heart to
thrill it&mdash;in thoughts that write their
meaning in the watchful eye, in words
that issue straight from the fount of
love, in acts that do not bear one
shade of selfish purpose. It was not
a labour of time to learn that the existence
of the child, her peace and
happiness, were merged in those of
<a class="pagenum" name="page332" id="page332" title="page332"></a>the fond parent. He was every thing
to her, as she to him. She had no
brother&mdash;he no wife: these natural
channels of affection cut away, the
stream was strong and deep that flowed
into each other's hearts. My first
interview with the young lady was
necessarily limited. I would gladly
have prolonged it. The morning was
passed with my pupils, and my mind
stole often from the work before me
to dwell upon the face and form of
her, whom, as a sister, I could have
doated on and cherished. How happy
I should have been, I deemed, if I
had been so blessed. Useless reflection!
and yet pleased was I to dwell
upon it, and to welcome its return, as
often as it recurred. At dinner we
met again. To be admitted into her
presence seemed the reward for my
morning toil&mdash;a privilege rather than
a right. What labour was too great
for the advantage of such moments?&mdash;moments
indeed they were, and
less&mdash;flashes of time, that were not
here before they had disappeared.
We exchanged but few words. I was
still oppressed with the conviction of
my own unworthiness, and wondered
if she could read in my burning face
the history of shame. How she must
avoid and despise me, thought I, when
she has discovered all, and how bold
and wicked it was to darken the light
in which she lived with the guilt that
was a part of me! Not the less did I
experience this when she spoke to me
with kindness and unreserve. The
feeling grew in strength. I was conscious
of deceit and fraud, and could
not shake the knowledge off. I was
taking mean advantage of her confidence,
assuming a character to which
I had no claim, and listening to the
accents of innocence and virtue with
the equanimity of one good and spotless
as herself. In the afternoon the
young students resumed their work.
When it was over, we strolled amongst
the hills; and, at the close of a delightful
walk, found ourselves in the
enchanting village. Here we encountered
Miss Fairman and the incumbent,
and we returned home in company.
In one short hour we reached
it. How many hours have passed
since <i>that</i> was ravished from the hand
of Time, and registered in the tenacious
memory! Years have floated
by, and silently have dropped into the
boundless sea, unheeded, unregretted;
and these few minutes&mdash;sacred relics&mdash;live
and linger in the world, in
mercy it may be, to lighten up my
lonely hearth, or save the whitened
head from drooping. The spirit of
one golden hour shall hover through
a life, and shed glory where he falls.
What are the unfruitful, unremembered
years that rush along, frightening
mortality with their fatal speed&mdash;an
instant in eternity! What are the
moments loaded with passion, intense,
and never-dying&mdash;years, ages upon
earth! Away with the divisions of
time, whilst one short breath&mdash;the
smallest particle or measure of duration,
shall outweigh ages. Breathless
and silent is the dewy eve. Trailing
a host of glittering clouds behind him,
the sun stalks down, and leaves the
emerald hills in deeper green. The
lambs are skipping on the path&mdash;the
shepherd as loth to lead them home
as they to go. The labourer has done
his work, and whistles his way back.
The minister has much of good and
wise to say to his young family. They
hear the business of the day; their
guardian draws the moral, and bids
them think it over. Upon my arm I
bear his child, the fairest object of the
twilight group. She tells me histories
of this charmed spot, and the good
old tales that are as old as the gray
church beneath us: she smiles, and
speaks of joys amongst the hills, ignorant
of the tearful eye and throbbing
heart beside her, that overflow
with new-found bliss, and cannot bear
their weight of happiness.</p>

<p>Another day of natural gladness&mdash;and
then the Sabbath; this not less
cheerful and inspiriting than the preceding.
The sun shone fair upon the
ancient church, and made its venerable
gray stones sparkle and look young
again. The dark-green ivy that for
many a year has clung there, looked
no longer sad and sombre, but gay
and lively as the newest of the new-born
leaves that smiled on every tree.
The inhabitants of the secluded village
were already a-foot when we
proceeded from the parsonage, and
men and women from adjacent villages
were on the road to join them.
The deep-toned bell pealed solemnly,
and sanctified the vale; for its sound
strikes deeply ever on the broad ear
of nature. Willows and yew-trees
shelter the graves of the departed villagers,
and the living wend their way
<a class="pagenum" name="page333" id="page333" title="page333"></a>beneath them, subdued to seriousness,
it may be, by the breathless voice that
dwells in every well-remembered
mound. There is not one who does
not carry on his brow the thoughts
that best become it now. All are well
dressed, all look cleanly and contented.
The children are with their parents,
their natural and best instructors.
Whom should they love so
well? To whom is honour due if not
to them? The village owns no school
to disannul the tie of blood, to warp
and weaken the affection that holds
them well together.</p>

<p>All was quietness and decorum in
the house of prayer. Every earnest
eye was fixed, not upon Mr Fairman,
but on the book from which the people
prayed, in which they found their
own good thoughts portrayed, their
pious wishes told, their sorrow and
repentance in clearest form described.
Every humble penitent was on his
knees. With one voice, loud and
heartfelt, came the responses which
spoke the people's acquiescence in all
the pastor urged and prayed on their
behalf. The worship over, Mr Fairman
addressed his congregation, selecting
his subject from the lesson of
the day, and fitting his words to the
capacities of those who listened. Let
me particularly note, that whilst the
incumbent pointed distinctly to the
cross as the only ground of a sinner's
hope, he insisted upon good works as
the necessary and essential accompaniment
of his faith. &quot;Do not tell me,
my dear friends,&quot; he said, at the conclusion
of his address&mdash;&quot;do not tell
me that you believe, if your daily life
is unworthy a believer. I will not
trust you. What is your belief, if
your heart is busy in contrivances to
overreach your neighbour? What is
it, if your mind is filled with envy,
malice, hatred, and revenge? What
if you are given over to disgraceful
lusts&mdash;to drunkenness and debauchery?
What if you are ashamed to speak the
truth, and are willing to become a
liar? I tell you, and I have warrant
for what I say, that your conduct one
towards another must be straightforward,
honest, generous, kind, and affectionate,
or you cannot be in a safe
and happy state. You owe it to yourselves
to be so; for if you are poor
and labouring men, you have an immortal
soul within you, and it is your
greatest ornament. It is that which
gives the meanest of us a dignity that
no earthly honours can supply; a dignity
that it becomes the first and last
of us by every means to cherish and
support. Is it not, my friends, degrading,
fearful to know that we bear
about with us the very image of our
God, and that we are acting worse
than the very brutes of the field? Do
yourselves justice. Be pure&mdash;pure in
mind and body. Be honest, in word
and deed. Be loving to one another.
Crush every wish to do evil, or to
speak harshly; be brothers, and feel
that you are working out the wishes
of a benevolent and loving Father,
who has created you for love, and
smiles upon you when you do his bidding.&quot;
There was more to this effect,
but nothing need be added to explain
the scope and tendency of his discourse.
His congregation could not mistake
his meaning; they could not fail to
profit by it, if reason was not proof
against the soundest argument. As
quietly as, and, if it be possible, more
seriously than, they entered the church,
did the small band of worshippers, at
the close of the service, retire from it.
Could it be my fancy, or did the wife
in truth cling closer to her husband&mdash;the
father clasp his little boy more
firmly in his hand? Did neighbour
nod to neighbour more eagerly as they
parted at the churchyard gate&mdash;did
every look and movement of the many
groups bespeak a spirit touched, a
mind reproved? I may not say so,
for my own heart was melted by the
scene, and might mislead my judgment.
There was a second service in
the afternoon. This concluded, we
walked to the sea-beach. In the evening
Mr Fairman related a connected
history from the Old Testament,
whilst the pupils tracked his progress
on their maps, and the narrative became
a living thing in their remembrances.
Serious conversation then
succeeded; to this a simple prayer,
and the day closed, sweetly and calmly,
as a day might close in Paradise.</p>

<p>The events of the following month
partook of the character of those already
glanced at. The minister was
unremitting in his attendance upon
his parishioners, and no day passed
during which something had not been
accomplished for their spiritual improvement
or worldly comfort. His
loving daughter was a handmaid at
his side, ministering with him, and
<a class="pagenum" name="page334" id="page334" title="page334"></a>shedding sunshine where she came.
The villagers were frugal and industrious;
and seemed, for the most part,
sensible of their incumbent's untiring
efforts. Improvement appeared even
in the cottage of the desperate Warden.
Mr Fairman obtained employment for
him. For a fortnight he had attended
to it, and no complaint had reached
the parsonage of misbehaviour. His
wife had learned to bear her imagined
wrongs in silence, and could even
submit to a visit from her best friend
without insulting him for the condescension.
My own days passed
smoothly on. My occupation grew
every day more pleasing, and the results
of my endeavours as gratifying
as I could wish them. My pupils were
attached to me, and I beheld them improving
gradually and securely under
their instruction. Mr Fairman, who,
for a week together, had witnessed the
course of my tuition, and watched it
narrowly, was pleased to express his
approbation in the warmest terms.
Much of the coldness with which I
thought he had at first encountered
me disappeared, and his manner grew
daily more friendly and confiding. His
treatment was most generous. He
received me into the bosom of his
family as a son, and strove to render
his fair habitation my genuine and natural
home.</p>

<p>Another month passed by, and the
colour and tone of my existence had
suffered a momentous change. In the
acquirement of a fearful joy, I had
lost all joy. In rendering every moment
of my life blissful and ecstatic,
I had robbed myself of all felicity. A
few weeks before, and my state of
being had realized a serenity that defied
all causes of perturbation and disquiet.
Now it was a sea of agitation
and disorder; and a breath, a nothing
had brought the restless waves upon
the quiet surface. Through the kindness
of Mr Fairman, my evenings had
been almost invariably passed in the society
of himself and his daughter. The
lads were early risers, and retired, on
that account, at a very early hour to
rest. Upon their dismission, I had
been requested to join the company in
the drawing-room. This company included
sometimes Doctor Mayhew,
the neighbouring squire, or a chance
visitor, but consisted oftenest only of
the incumbent and his daughter.
Aware of the friendly motive which
suggested the request, I obeyed it with
alacrity. On these occasions, Miss
Fairman used her pencil, whilst I read
aloud; or she would ply her needle,
and soothe at intervals her father's
ear with strains of music, which he, for
many reasons, loved to hear. Once or
twice the incumbent had been called
away, and his child and I were left
together. I had no reason to be silent
whilst the good minister was present,
yet I found that I could speak more
confidently and better when he was
absent. We conversed with freedom
and unrestraint. I found the maiden's
mind well stored&mdash;her voice was not
more sweet than was her understanding
clear and cloudless. Books had
been her joy, which, in the season of
suffering, had been my consolation.
They were a common source of pleasure.
She spoke of them with feeling,
and I could understand her. I regarded
her with deep unfeigned respect; but,
the evening over, I took my leave, as
I had come&mdash;in peace. Miss Fairman
left the parsonage to pay a two-days'
visit at a house in the vicinity. Until
the evening of the first day I was not
sensible of her absence. It was then,
and at the customary hour of our reunion,
that, for the first time, I experienced,
with alarm, a sense of loneliness
and desertion&mdash;that I became tremblingly
conscious of the secret growth
of an affection that had waited only
for the time and circumstance to make
its presence and its power known and
dreaded. In the daily enjoyment of
her society, I had not estimated its
influence and value. Once denied it,
and I dared not acknowledge to myself
how precious it had become, how
silently and fatally it had wrought
upon my heart. The impropriety and
folly of self-indulgence were at once
apparent&mdash;yes, the vanity and wickedness&mdash;and,
startled by what looked
like guilt, I determined manfully to
rise superior to temptation. I took
refuge in my books; they lacked their
usual interest, were ineffectual in reducing
the ruffled mind to order. I
rose and paced my room, but I could
not escape from agitating thought. I
sought the minister in his study, and
hoped to bring myself to calm and
reason by dwelling seriously on the
business of the day&mdash;with him, the
father of the lady, and <i>my master</i>. He
was not there. He had left the parsonage
with Doctor Mayhew an hour
<a class="pagenum" name="page335" id="page335" title="page335"></a>before. I walked into the open air
restless and unhappy, relying on the
freshness and repose of night to be
subdued and comforted. It was a
night to soften anger&mdash;to conquer
envy&mdash;to destroy revenge&mdash;beautiful
and bright. The hills were bathed in
liquid silvery light, and on their heights,
and in the vale, on all around, lay
passion slumbering. What could I
find on such a night, but favour and
incitement, support and confirmation,
flattery and delusion? Every object
ministered to the imagination, and
love had given that wings. I trembled
as I pursued my road, and fuel found
its unobstructed way rapidly to the
flame within. Self-absorbed, I wandered
on. I did not choose my path.
I believed I did not, and I stopped at
length&mdash;before the house that held
her. I gazed upon it with reverence
and love. One room was lighted up.
Shadows flitted across the curtained
window, and my heart throbbed sensibly
when, amongst them, I imagined
I could trace her form. I was borne
down by a conviction of wrong and
culpability, but I could not move, or
for a moment draw away my look. It
was a strange assurance that I felt&mdash;but
I did feel it, strongly and
emphatically&mdash;that I should see her palpably
before I left the place. I waited for
that sight in certain expectation, and
it came. A light was carried from
the room. Diminished illumination
there, and sudden brightness against a
previously darkened casement, made
this evident. The light ascended&mdash;another
casement higher than the last
was, in its turn, illumined, and it betrayed
her figure. She approached
the window, and, for an instant&mdash;oh
how brief!&mdash;looked into the heavenly
night. My poor heart sickened with
delight, and I strained my eyes long
after all was blank and dark again.</p>

<p>Daylight, and the employments of
day, if they did not remove, weakened
the turbulence of the preceding
night. The more I found my passion
acquiring mastery, with greater
vigour I renewed my work, and with
more determination I pursued the
objects that were most likely to fight
and overcome it. I laboured with the
youths for a longer period. I undertook
to prepare a composition for the
following day which I knew must take
much thought and many hours in
working out. I armed myself at all
points&mdash;but the evening came and
found me once more conscious of
a void that left me prostrate. Mr
Fairman was again absent from home.
I could not rest in it, and I too sallied
forth, but this time, to the village. I
would not deliberately offer violence
to my conscience, and I shrunk from
a premeditated visit to the distant
house. My own acquaintances in
the village were not many, or of long
standing, but there were some half
dozen, especial favourites of the incumbent's
daughter. To one of these
I bent my steps, with no other purpose
than that of baffling time that
hung upon me painfully and heavily
at home. For a few minutes I spoke
with the aged female of the house on
general topics; then a passing observation&mdash;in
spite of me&mdash;escaped my
lips in reference to Miss Ellen. The
villager took up the theme and expatiated
widely. There was no end to
what she had to say of good and kind
for the dear lady. I could have hugged
her for her praise. Prudence bade
me forsake the dangerous ground, and
so I did, to return again with tenfold
curiosity and zest. I asked a hundred
questions, each one revealing more
interest and ardour than the last, and
involving me in deeper peril. It was
at length accomplished. My companion
hesitated suddenly in a discourse,
then stopped, and looked me in the
face, smiling cunningly. &quot;I tell you
what, sir,&quot; she exclaimed at last, and
loudly, &quot;you are over head and ears
in love, and that's the truth on't.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hush, good woman,&quot; I replied,
blushing to the forehead, and hastening
to shut an open door. &quot;Don't
speak so loud. You mistake, it is no
such thing. I shall be angry if you
say so&mdash;very angry. What can you
mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just what I say, sir. Why, do
you know how old I am? Seventy-three.
I think I ought to tell, and
where's the harm of it? Who couldn't
love the sweetest lady in the parish&mdash;bless
her young feeling heart!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I tell you&mdash;you mistake&mdash;you are
to blame. I command you not to repeat
this to a living soul. If it should
come to the incumbent's ears&quot;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Trust me for that, sir. I'm no
blab. He shan't be wiser for such as
me. But do you mean to tell me, sir,
with that red face of your'n, you
haven't lost your heart&mdash;leave alone
<a class="pagenum" name="page336" id="page336" title="page336"></a>your trembling? ah, well, I hopes
you'll both be happy, anyhow.&quot;</p>

<p>I endeavoured to remonstrate, but
the old woman only laughed and shook
her aged head. I left her, grieved
and apprehensive. My secret thoughts
had been discovered. How soon
might they be carried to the confiding
minister and his unsuspecting daughter!
What would they think of me!
It was a day of anxiety and trouble,
that on which Miss Fairman returned
to the parsonage. I received my
usual invitation; but I was indisposed,
and did not go. I resolved to see her
only during meals, and when it was
impossible to avoid her. I would not
seek her presence. Foolish effort!
It had been better to pass hours in
her sight, for previous separation made
union more intense, and the passionate
enjoyment of a fleeting instant
was hoarded up, and became nourishment
for the livelong day.</p>

<p>It was a soft rich afternoon in
June, and chance made me the companion
of Miss Fairman. We were
alone: I had encountered her at a distance
of about a mile from the parsonage,
on the sea-shore, whither I had
walked distressed in spirit, and grateful
for the privilege of listening in gloomy
quietude to the soothing sounds of
nature&mdash;medicinal ever. The lady
was at my side almost before I was
aware of her approach. My heart
throbbed whilst she smiled upon me,
sweetly as she smiled on all. Her
deep hazel eye was moist. Could it
be from weeping?</p>

<p>&quot;What has happened, Miss Fairman?&quot;
I asked immediately.</p>

<p>&quot;Do I betray my weakness, then?&quot;
she answered. &quot;I am sorry for it;
for dear papa tells all the villagers
that no wise man weeps&mdash;and no wise
woman either, I suppose. But I cannot
help it. We are but a small family
in the village, and it makes me
very sad to miss the old faces one after
another, and to see old friends dropping
and dropping into the silent
grave.&quot;</p>

<p>As she spoke the church-bell tolled,
and she turned pale, and ceased. I
offered her my arm, and we walked
on.</p>

<p>&quot;Whom do you mourn, Miss
Fairman?&quot; I asked at length.</p>

<p>&quot;A dear good friend&mdash;my best and
oldest. When poor mamma was
dying, she made me over to her care.
She was her nurse, and was mine for
years. It is very wrong of me to weep
for her. She was good and pious,
and is blest.&quot;</p>

<p>The church-bell tolled again, and
my companion shuddered.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! I cannot listen to that bell,&quot;
she said. &quot;I wish papa would do
away with it. What a withering
sound it has! I heard it first when it
was tolling for my dear mother. It
fell upon my heart like iron then, and
it falls so now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I cannot say that I dislike the
melancholy chime. Death is sad. Its
messenger should not be gay.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is the soul that sees and hears.
Beauty and music are created quickly
if the heart be joyful. So my book says,
and it is true. You have had no cause
to think that bell a hideous thing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yet I have suffered youth's severest
loss. I have lost a mother.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You speak the truth. Yes, I have
a kind father left me&mdash;and you&quot;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;I am an orphan, friendless and
deserted. God grant, Miss Fairman,
you may be spared my fate for years.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not friendless or deserted either,
Mr Stukely,&quot; answered the young
lady kindly; &quot;papa does not deserve,
I am sure, that you should speak so
harshly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pardon me, Miss Fairman. I did
not mean to say that. He has been
most generous to me&mdash;kinder than I
deserve. But I have borne much,
and still must bear. The fatherless
and motherless is in the world alone.
He needs no greater punishment.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You must not talk so. Papa will,
I am sure, be a father to you, as he is
to all who need one. You do not
know him, Mr Stukely. His heart is
overflowing with tenderness and charity.
You cannot judge him by his
manner. He has had his share of sorrow
and misfortune; and death has
been at his door oftener than once.
Friends have been unfaithful and men
have been ungrateful; but trial and
suffering have not hardened him. You
have seen him amongst the poor, but
you have not seen him as I have; nor
have I beheld him as his Maker has,
in the secret workings of his spirit,
which is pure and good, believe me.
He has received injury like a child,
and dealt mercy and love with the liberality
of an angel. Trust my father,
Mr Stukely.&quot;&mdash;</p>

<p>The maiden spoke quickly and
<a class="pagenum" name="page337" id="page337" title="page337"></a>passionately, and her neck and face
crimsoned with animation. I quivered,
for her tones communicated fire&mdash;but
my line of conduct was marked,
and it shone clear in spite of the clouds
of emotion which strove to envelope
and conceal it&mdash;as they did too soon.</p>

<p>&quot;I would trust him, Miss Fairman,
and I do,&quot; I answered with a faltering
tongue. &quot;I appreciate his character
and I revere him. I could have made
my home with him. I prayed that I
might do so. Heaven seemed to have
directed my steps to this blissful spot,
and to have pointed out at length a
resting place for my tired feet. I have
been most happy here&mdash;too happy&mdash;I
have proved ungrateful, and I know
how rashly I have forfeited this and
every thing. I cannot live here. This
is no home for me. I will go into the
world again&mdash;cast myself upon it&mdash;do
any thing. I could be a labourer
on the highways, and be contented
if I could see that I had done my duty,
and behaved with honour. Believe
me, Miss Fairman, I have not deliberately
indulged&mdash;I have struggled,
fought, and battled, till my brain has
tottered. I am wretched and forlorn&mdash;but
I will leave you&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;would
that I had never come&mdash;&mdash;.&quot;
I could say no more. My full heart
spoke its agony in tears.</p>

<p>&quot;What has occurred? What afflicts
you? You alarm me, Mr Stukely.&quot;</p>

<p>I had sternly determined to permit
no one look to give expression to the
feeling which consumed me, to obstruct
by force the passage of the remotest
hint that should struggle to
betray me; but as the maiden looked
full and timidly upon me, I felt in defiance
of me, and against all opposition,
the tell-tale passion rising from
my soul, and creeping to my eye. It
would not be held back. In an instant,
with one treacherous glance, all
was spoken and revealed.</p>

<h2>IMAGINARY CONVERSATION. BY WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.</h2>

<h3>SANDT AND KOTZEBUE.</h3>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;Generally men of letters in our days, contrary to the practice of
antiquity, are little fond of admitting the young and unlearned into their
studies or their society.</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;They should rather those than others. The young <i>must</i> cease
to be young, and the unlearned <i>may</i> cease to be unlearned. According to the
letters you bring with you, sir, there is only youth against you. In the seclusion
of a college life, you appear to have studied with much assiduity and advantage,
and to have pursued no other courses than the paths of wisdom.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;Do you approve of the pursuit?</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;Who does not?</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;None, if you will consent that they direct the chase, bag the game,
inebriate some of the sportsmen, and leave the rest behind in the slough.
May I ask you another question?</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;Certainly.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;Where lie the paths of wisdom? I did not expect, my dear sir
to throw you back upon your chair. I hope it was no rudeness to seek information
from you?</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;The paths of wisdom, young man, are those which lead us to
truth and happiness.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;If they lead us away from fortune, from employments, from civil
and political utility; if they cast us where the powerful persecute, where the
rich trample us down, and where the poorer (at seeing it) despise us, rejecting
our counsel and spurning our consolation, what valuable truth do they
enable us to discover, or what rational happiness to expect? To say that
wisdom leads to truth, is only to say that wisdom leads to wisdom; for such
is truth. Nonsense is better than falsehood; and we come to that.</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;How?</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;No falsehood is more palpable than that wisdom leads to happiness&mdash;I
mean in this world; in another, we may well indeed believe that
the words are constructed of very different materials. But here we are,
standing on a barren molehill that crumbles and sinks under our tread; here
we are, and show me from hence, Von Kotzebue, a discoverer who has not
suffered for his discovery, whether it be of a world or of a truth&mdash;whether a
Columbus or a Galileo. Let us come down lower: Show me a man who
has detected the injustice of a law, the absurdity of a tenet, the malversation
of a minister, or the impiety of a priest, and who has not been stoned, or
hanged, or burnt, or imprisoned, or exiled, or reduced to poverty. The chain
of Prometheus is hanging yet upon his rock, and weaker limbs writhe daily
in its rusty links. Who then, unless for others, would be a darer of wisdom?
And yet, how full of it is even the inanimate world? We may gather it out
of stones and straws. Much lies within the reach of all: little has been
collected by the wisest of the wise. O slaves to passion! O minions to power!
ye carry your own scourges about you; ye endure their tortures daily; yet
ye crouch for more. Ye believe that God beholds you; ye know that he will
punish you, even worse than ye punish yourselves; and still ye lick the dust
where the Old Serpent went before you.</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;I am afraid, sir, you have formed to yourself a romantic and
strange idea, both of happiness and of wisdom.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;I too am afraid it may be so. My idea of happiness is, the power
of communicating peace, good-will, gentle affections, ease, comfort, independence,
freedom, to all men capable of them.</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;The idea is, truly, no humble one.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;A higher may descend more securely on a stronger mind. The
power of communicating those blessings to the capable, is enough for my
aspirations. A stronger mind may exercise its faculties in the divine work of
creating the capacity.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page339" id="page339" title="page339"></a><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;Childish! childish!&mdash;Men have cravings enow already; give
them fresh capacities, and they will have fresh appetites. Let us be contented
in the sphere wherein it is the will of Providence to place us; and let us render
ourselves useful in it to the utmost of our power, without idle aspirations
after impracticable good.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;O sir! you lead me where I tremble to step; to the haunts of your
intellect, to the recesses of your spirit. Alas! alas! how small and how
vacant is the central chamber of the lofty pyramid?</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;Is this to me?</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;To you, and many mightier. Reverting to your own words; could
not you yourself have remained in the sphere you were placed in?</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;What sphere? I have written dramas, and novels, and travels.
I have been called to the Imperial Court of Russia.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;You sought celebrity.&mdash;I blame not that. The thick air of multitudes
may be good for some constitutions of mind, as the thinner of solitudes
is for others. Some horses will not run without the clapping of hands; others
fly out of the course rather than hear it. But let us come to the point. Imperial
courts! What do they know of letters? What letters do they countenance&mdash;do
they tolerate?</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;Plays.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;Playthings.</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;Travels.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;On their business. O ye paviours of the dreary road along which
their cannon rolls for conquest! my blood throbs at every stroke of your
rammers. When will ye lay them by?</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;We are not such drudges.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;Germans! Germans! Must ye never have a rood on earth ye can
call your own, in the vast inheritance of your fathers?</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;Those who strive and labour, gain it; and many have rich possessions.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;None; not the highest.</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;Perhaps you may think them insecure; but they are not lost yet,
although the rapacity of France does indeed threaten to swallow them up.
But her fraudulence is more to be apprehended than her force. The promise
of liberty is more formidable than the threat of servitude. The wise know
that she never will bring us freedom; the brave know that she never can
bring us thraldom. She herself is alike impatient of both; in the dazzle of
arms she mistakes the one for the other, and is never more agitated than in
the midst of peace.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;The fools that went to war against her, did the only thing that
could unite her; and every sword they drew was a conductor of that lightening
which fell upon their heads. But we must now look at our homes.
Where there is no strict union, there is no perfect love; and where no perfect
love, there is no true helper. Are you satisfied, sir, at the celebrity and
the distinctions you have obtained?</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;My celebrity and distinctions, if I must speak of them, quite
satisfy me. Neither in youth nor in advancing age&mdash;neither in difficult nor
in easy circumstances, have I ventured to proclaim myself the tutor or the
guardian of mankind.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;I understand the reproof, and receive it humbly and gratefully.
You did well in writing the dramas, and the novels, and the travels; but,
pardon my question, who called you to the courts of princes in strange
countries?</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;They themselves.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;They have no more right to take you away from your country,
than to eradicate a forest, or to subvert a church in it. You belong to the
land that bore you, and were not at liberty&mdash;(if right and liberty are one, and
unless they are, they are good for nothing)&mdash;you were not at liberty, I repeat
it, to enter into the service of an alien.</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;No magistrate, higher or lower, forbade me. Fine notions of
freedom are these!</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;A man is always a minor in regard to his fatherland; and the servants
<a class="pagenum" name="page340" id="page340" title="page340"></a>of his fatherland are wrong and criminal, if they whisper in his ear that
he may go away, that he may work in another country, that he may ask to be
fed in it, and that he may wait there until orders and tasks are given for his
hands to execute. Being a German, you voluntarily placed yourself in a
position where you might eventually be coerced to act against Germans.</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;I would not.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;Perhaps you think so.</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;Sir, I know my duty.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;We all do; yet duties are transgressed, and daily. Where the will
is weak in accepting, it is weaker in resisting. Already have you left the
ranks of your fellow-citizens&mdash;already have you taken the enlisting money and
marched away.</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;Phrases! metaphors! and let me tell you, M. Sandt, not very
polite ones. You have hitherto seen little of the world, and you speak rather
the language of books than of men.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;What! are books written by some creatures of less intellect than
ours? I fancied them to convey the language and reasonings of men. I was
wrong, and you are right, Von Kotzebue! They are, in general, the productions
of such as have neither the constancy of courage, nor the continuity of
sense, to act up to what they know to be right, or to maintain it, even in
words, to the end of their lives. You are aware that I am speaking now of
political ethics. This is the worst I can think of the matter, and bad enough
is this.</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;You misunderstand me. Our conduct must fall in with our
circumstances. We may be patriotic, yet not puritanical in our patriotism,
not harsh, nor intolerant, nor contracted. The philosophical mind should
consider the whole world as its habitation, and not look so minutely into it
as to see the lines that divide nations and governments; much less should it
act the part of a busy shrew, and take pleasure in giving loose to the tongue,
at finding things a little out of place.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;We will leave the shrew where we find her: she certainly is better
with the comedian than with the philosopher. But this indistinctness in the
moral and political line begets indifference. He who does not keep his own
country more closely in view than any other, soon mixes land with sea, and
sea with air, and loses sight of every thing, at least, for which he was placed
in contact with his fellow men. Let us unite, if possible, with the nearest:
Let usages and familiarities bind us: this being once accomplished, let us
confederate for security and peace with all the people round, particularly
with people of the same language, laws, and religion. We pour out wine to
those about us, wishing the same fellowship and conviviality to others: but
to enlarge the circle would disturb and deaden its harmony. We irrigate the
ground in our gardens: the public road may require the water equally: yet
we give it rather to our borders; and first to those that lie against the house!
God himself did not fill the world at once with happy creatures: he enlivened
one small portion of it with them, and began with single affections, as well as
pure and unmixt. We must have an object and an aim, or our strength, if
any strength belongs to us, will be useless.</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;There is much good sense in these remarks: but I am not at
all times at leisure and in readiness to receive instruction. I am old enough to
have laid down my own plans of life; and I trust I am by no means deficient
in the relations I bear to society.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;Lovest thou thy children? Oh! my heart bleeds! But the birds
can fly; and the nest requires no warmth from the parent, no cover against
the rain and the wind.</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;This is wildness: this is agony. Your face is laden with large
drops; some of them tears, some not. Be more rational and calm, my dear
young man! and less enthusiastic.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;They who will not let us be rational, make us enthusiastic by force.
Do you love your children? I ask you again. If you do, you must love them
more than another man's. Only they who are indifferent to all, profess a
parity.</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;Sir! indeed your conversation very much surprises me.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page341" id="page341" title="page341"></a><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;I see it does: you stare, and would look proud. Emperors and
kings, and all but maniacs, would lose that faculty with me. I could speedily
bring them to a just sense of their nothingness, unless their ears were calked
and pitched, although I am no Savonarola. He, too, died sadly!</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;Amid so much confidence of power, and such an assumption of
authority, your voice is gentle&mdash;almost plaintive.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;It should be plaintive. Oh, could it be but persuasive!</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;Why take this deep interest in me? I do not merit nor require
it. Surely any one would think we had been acquainted with each other for
many years.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;What! should I have asked you such a question as the last, after
long knowing you?</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>, (<i>aside</i>.)&mdash;This resembles insanity.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;The insane have quick ears, sir, and sometimes quick apprehensions.</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;I really beg your pardon.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;I ought not then to have heard you, and beg yours. My madness
could release many from a worse; from a madness which hurts them grievously;
a madness which has been and will be hereditary: mine, again and again
I repeat it, would burst asunder the strong swathes that fasten them to pillar
and post. Sir! sir! if I entertained not the remains of respect for you, in
your domestic state, I should never have held with you this conversation.
Germany is Germany: she ought to have nothing political in common with
what is not Germany. Her freedom and security now demand that she celebrate
the communion of the faithful. Our country is the only one in all the
explored regions on earth that never has been conquered. Arabia and Russia
boast it falsely; France falsely; Rome falsely. A fragment off the empire of
Darius fell and crushed her: Valentinian was the footstool of Sapor, and
Rome was buried in Byzantium. Boys must not learn this, and men will not.
Britain, the wealthiest and most powerful of nations, and, after our own, the
most literate and humane, received from us colonies and laws. Alas! those
laws, which she retains as her fairest heritage, we value not: we surrender
them to gangs of robbers, who fortify themselves within walled cities, and
enter into leagues against us. When they quarrel, they push us upon one
another's sword, and command us to thank God for the victories that enslave
us. These are the glories we celebrate; these are the festivals we hold, on
the burial-mounds of our ancestors. Blessed are those who lie under them!
blessed are also those who remember what they were, and call upon their
names in the holiness of love.</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;Moderate the transport that inflames and consumes you. There
is no dishonour in a nation being conquered by a stronger.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;There may be great dishonour in letting it be stronger; great, for
instance, in our disunion.</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;We have only been conquered by the French in our turn.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;No, sir, no: we have not been, in turn or out. Our puny princes
were disarmed by promises and lies: they accepted paper crowns from the
very thief who was sweeping into his hat their forks and spoons. A cunning
traitor snared incautious ones, plucked them, devoured them, and slept upon
their feathers.</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;I would rather turn back with you to the ancient glories of our
country than fix my attention on the sorrowful scenes more near to us. We
may be justly proud of our literary men, who unite the suffrages of every
capital, to the exclusion of almost all their own.</p>

and hirelings.</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;The English and the Greeks are the only nations that rival us
in poetry, or in any works of imagination.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;While on this high ground we pretend to a rivalship with England
and Greece, can we reflect, without a sinking of the heart, on our inferiority
in political and civil dignity? Why are we lower than they? Our mothers
are like their mothers; our children are like their children; our limbs are as
strong, our capacities are as enlarged, our desire of improvement in the arts
<a class="pagenum" name="page342" id="page342" title="page342"></a>and sciences is neither less vivid and generous, nor less temperate and well-directed.
The Greeks were under disadvantages which never bore in any
degree on us; yet they rose through them vigorously and erectly. They
were Asiatic in what ought to be the finer part of the affections; their women
were veiled and secluded, never visited the captive, never released the slave,
never sat by the sick in the hospital, never heard the child's lesson repeated
in the school. Ours are more tender, compassionate, and charitable, than
poets have feigned of the past, or prophets have announced of the future;
and, nursed at their breasts and educated at their feet, blush we not at our
degeneracy? The most indifferent stranger feels a pleasure at finding, in
the worst-written history of Spain, her various kingdoms ultimately mingled,
although the character of the governors, and perhaps of the governed, is congenial
to few. What delight, then, must overflow on Europe, from seeing
the mother of her noblest nation rear again her venerable head, and bless all
her children for the first time united!</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;I am bound to oppose such a project.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;Say not so: in God's name, say not so.</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;In such confederacy I see nothing but conspiracy and rebellion,
and I am bound, I tell you again, sir, to defeat it, if possible.</p>

<p><i>Sandt.</i>&mdash;Bound! I must then release you.</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;How should you, young gentleman, release me?</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;May no pain follow the cutting of the knot! But think again:
think better: spare me!</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;I will not betray you.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;That would serve nobody: yet, if in your opinion betraying me
can benefit you or your family, deem it no harm; so much greater has been
done by you in abandoning the cause of Germany. Here is your paper;
here is your ink.</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;Do you imagine me an informer?</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;From maxims and conduct such as yours, spring up the brood, the
necessity, and the occupation of them. There would be none, if good men
thought it a part of goodness to be as active and vigilant as the bad. I must
go, sir! Return to yourself in time! How it pains me to think of losing you!
Be my friend!</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;I would be.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>.&mdash;Be a German!</p>

<p><i>Kotzebue</i>.&mdash;I am.</p>

<p><i>Sandt</i>, (<i>having gone out</i>.)&mdash;Perjurer and profaner! Yet his heart is kindly.
I must grieve for him! Away with tenderness! I disrobe him of the privilege
to pity me or to praise me, as he would have done had I lived of old.
Better men shall do more. God calls them: me too he calls: I will enter the
door again. May the greater sacrifice bring the people together, and hold
them evermore in peace and concord. The lesser victim follows willingly.

<h2>THE JEWELLER'S WIFE.</h2>

<h3>A PASSAGE IN THE CAREER OF EL EMPECINADO.</h3>

<p>When the Empecinado, after escaping
from the Burgo de Osma, rejoined
his band, and again repaired to the
favourite skirmishing ground on the
banks of the Duero, he found the state
of affairs in Old Castile becoming
daily less favourable for his operations.
The French overran the greater
part of the province, and visited
with severe punishment any disobedience
of their orders; so that the
peasantry no longer dared to assist
the guerillas as they had previously
done. Many of the villages on the
Duero had become <i>afrancesados</i>, not,
it is true, through love, but through
dread of the invaders, and in the hope
of preserving themselves from pillage
and oppression. However much the
people in their hearts might wish success
to men like the Empecinado, the
guerillas were too few and too feeble
to afford protection to those who, by
giving them assistance or information,
would incur the displeasure of the
French. The clergy were the only
class that, almost without an exception,
remained stanch to the cause
of Spanish independence, and their
purses and refectories were ever open
to those who took up arms in its defence.</p>

<p>Noways deterred by this unfavourable
aspect of affairs, the Empecinado
resolved to carry on the war in Old
Castile, even though unaided and alone.
He established his bivouac in the pine-woods
of Coca, and sent out spies towards
Somosierra and Burgos, to get
information of some convoy of which
the capture might yield both honour
and profit.</p>

<p>It was on the second morning after
the departure of the spies, and a few
minutes before daybreak, that the
little camp was aroused by a shot from
a sentry, placed on the skirt of the
wood. In an instant every man was
on his feet. It was the Empecinado's
custom, when outlying in this manner,
to make one-half his band sleep fully
armed and equipped, with their horses
saddled and bridled beside them; and
a fortunate precaution it was in this
instance. Scarcely had the men time
to untether and spring upon their
horses, when the sentry galloped
headlong into the camp.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Los Franceses! Los Franceses</i>!&quot;
exclaimed he, breathless with speed.</p>

<p>One of the Empecinado's first qualities
was his presence of mind, which
never deserted him even in the most
critical situations. Instantly forming
up that moiety of his men which was
already in the saddle, he left a detachment
in front of those who were hastily
saddling and arming, and with the remainder
retired a little to the left of
the open ground on which the bivouac
was established. Almost before he
had completed this arrangement, the
jingling of arms and clattering of
horses' feet were heard, and a squadron
of French cavalry galloped
down the glade. The Empecinado
gave the word to charge, and as
Fuentes at the head of one party advanced
to meet them, he himself attacked
them in flank. The French,
not having anticipated much opposition
from a foe whom they had expected
to find sleeping, were somewhat
surprized at the fierce resistance
they met. A hard fight took place,
rendered still more confused by the
darkness, or rather by a faint grey
light, which was just beginning to appear,
and gave a shadowy indistinctness
to surrounding objects. The
Spaniards were inferior in number to
their opponents, and it was beginning
to go hard with them, when the remainder
of the guerillas, now armed
and mounted, came up to their assistance.
On perceiving this accession
to their adversaries' force, the French
thought they had been led into an
ambuscade, and retreating in tolerable
order to the edge of the wood, at last
fairly turned tail and ran for it, leaving
several killed and wounded on the
ground, and were pursued for some distance
by the guerillas, who, however,
only succeeded in making one prisoner.
This was a young man in the dress of
a peasant, who being badly mounted,
was easily overtaken. On being
brought before the Empecinado, the
latter with no small surprize recognized
<a class="pagenum" name="page344" id="page344" title="page344"></a>a native of Aranda, named Pedro
Gutierrez, who was one of the
emissaries he had sent out two days
previously to get information concerning
the movements of the enemy.</p>

<p>With pale cheek and faltering
voice, the prisoner answered the Empecinado's
interrogatories. It appears
that he had been detected as a spy by
the French, who had given him his
choice between a halter and the betrayal
of his countrymen and employers.
With the fear of death before
his eyes, he had consented to turn
traitor.</p>

<p>The deepest silence prevailed among
the guerillas during his narrative, and
remained unbroken for a full minute
after he had concluded. The Empecinado's
brow was black as thunder,
and his features assumed an expression
which the trembling wretch well
knew how to interpret.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Que podia hacer, se&ntilde;ores</i>?&quot; said
the culprit, casting an appealing, imploring
glance around him. &quot;The
rope was round my neck; I have an
aged father and am his only support.
Life is very sweet. What could I
do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Die</i>!&quot; replied the Empecinado,
in his deep stern voice&mdash;&quot;Die like a
man <i>then</i>, instead of dying like a dog
<i>now</i>!&quot;</p>

<p>He turned his back upon him, and
ten minutes later, the body of the unfortunate
spy was dangling from the
branches of a neighbouring tree, and
the guerillas marched off to seek another
and a safer bivouac.</p>

<p>A few days after this incident the
other spies returned, and after receiving
their report, and consulting with
his lieutenant, Mariano Fuentes, the
Empecinado broke up the little camp,
and led his band in the direction of
the <i>camino r&eacute;al</i>.</p>

<p>Along that part of the high-road,
from Madrid to the Pyrenees, which
winds through the mountain range of
Onrubias, an escort of fifty French
dragoons was marching, about an hour
before dusk, on an evening of early
spring. Two carriages, and three or
four heavily-laden carts, each drawn
by half-a-dozen mules, composed the
whole of the convoy; the value of
which, however, might be deemed
considerable, judging from the strength
of the escort, and the precautions observed
by the officer in command to
avoid a surprise&mdash;precautions which
were not of much avail; for, on reaching
a spot where the road widened
considerably, and was traversed by a
broad ravine, the party was suddenly
charged on either flank by double their
number of guerillas. The dragoons
made a gallant resistance, but it was
a short one, for they had no room or
time to form in any order, and were
far overmatched in the hand-to-hand
contest that ensued. With the very
first who fled went a gentleman in
civilian's garb, who sprang out of the
most elegant of the two carriages, and
mounting a fine Andalusian horse led
by a groom, was off like the wind,
disregarding the shrieks of his travelling
companion, a female two or three-and-twenty
years old, of great beauty,
and very richly attired. The cries
and alarm of the lady thus deserted
were redoubled, when an instant later
a guerilla of fierce aspect presented
himself at the carriage-door.</p>

<p>&quot;Have no fear, se&ntilde;ora,&quot; said the
Empecinado, &quot;you are in the hands
of honourable men, and no harm shall
be done you.&quot; And having by suchlike
assurances succeeded in calming
her terrors, he obtained from her
some information as to the contents
of the carts and carriages, as well as
regarding herself and her late companion.</p>

<p>The man who had abandoned her,
and consulted his own safety by flying
with the escort, was her husband,
Monsieur Barbot, jeweller and diamond
merchant to the late King
Charles the Fourth. Alarmed by the
unsettled state of things in Spain, he
was hastening to take refuge in France,
with his handsome wife and his great
wealth&mdash;of the latter of which no inconsiderable
portion was contained in
the carriage, in the shape of caskets
of jewellery, diamonds, and other
valuables.</p>

<p>Repairing to the neighbouring
mountains, the guerillas proceeded to
examine their booty, which the Empecinado
permitted them to divide
among themselves, with the exception
of the carriage and its contents, including
the lady, which he reserved
for his own share.</p>

<p>On the following day came letters
from the French military governor of
Aranda del Duero, and from Monsieur
Barbot, who had taken refuge in that
town, and offered a large sum as ransom
for his wife. To this application
<a class="pagenum" name="page345" id="page345" title="page345"></a>the Empecinado did not vouchsafe
any answer, but marched off to his
native village of Castrillo, taking with
him jewels, carriage, and lady. The
latter he established in the house of
his brother Manuel, recommending
her to the care of his sister-in-law,
and commanding that she should be
treated with all possible respect, and
her wishes attended to on every point.</p>

<p>The Empecinado's exultation at
the success of his enterprize was great,
but he little foresaw all the danger
and trouble that his rich capture was
hereafter to occasion him. He had
become violently enamoured of his fair
prisoner, and in order to have leisure
to pay his court to her, he sent off his
partida on a distant expedition under
the command of Fuentes, and himself
remained at Castrillo, doing his utmost
to find favour in the eyes of the
beautiful Madame Barbot. He was then
in the prime of life, a remarkably
handsome man, and notwithstanding
that the French affected to treat him
as a brigand, his courage and patriotism
were admitted by the unprejudiced
among all parties, and his bold
and successful deeds had already
procured him a degree of renown that
was an additional recommendation of
him to the fair sex. It may not,
therefore, be deemed very surprising
that, after the first few days of her
captivity were passed, and she had
become a little used to the novelty of
her position, the lady began to consider
the Empecinado with some
degree of favour, and seemed not altogether
disposed to be inconsolable in
her widowhood. He on his part spared
no pains to please her. His very nature
seemed changed by the violence
of his new passion; and so great was
the metamorphosis that his best friends
scarcely recognized him for the same
man. He seemed totally to have forgotten
the career to which he had devoted
himself, and the hatred and
war of extermination he had vowed
against the French. The restless activity
and spirit of enterprize which
formed such distinguishing traits in
his character, were completely lulled
to sleep by the charms of the fair
Barbot. Nor was the change in his
external appearance less striking.
Aware that the rude manners and
attire of a guerilla were not likely to
please the fastidious taste of a town-bred
dame, he hastened to discard
them. His rough bushy beard and
mustaches were carefully trimmed
and adjusted by the most expert barber
of the neighbourhood; his
sheepskin jacket, heavy boots, and jingling
double-roweled spurs thrown aside,
and in their place he assumed the national
garb, so well adapted to show
off a handsome person, and which,
although now almost disused throughout
Spain, far surpasses in elegance the
prevailing costumes of the nineteenth
century: a short light jacket of black
velvet, and waistcoat of the richest
silk, both profusely decorated with
gold filigree buttons; purple velvet
breeches fastened at the knee with
bunches of ribands; silk stockings,
and falling boots of chamois leather,
by the most expert maker in Cordova;
a crimson silk sash round his waist,
and round his neck a silk handkerchief,
of which the ends were drawn
through a magnificent jewelled ring.
A green velvet cap, ornamented with
sables and silver, and an ample cloak
trimmed with silver lace, the spoil of
a commandant of French gendarmes,
completed this picturesque costume.</p>

<p>Thus attired, and mounted on a
splendid horse, the Empecinado escorted
the object of his new flame to
all the f&ecirc;tes and merry-makings of the
surrounding country. Not a <i>romeria</i>
in the neighbouring villages, not a
fair or a bull-fight in all the valley of
the Duero, but were graced by the
presence of Martin Diez and his dulcinea,
whose fine horse and gallant
equipment, but more especially the
beauty of the rider, inspired universal
admiration. As might be expected,
many of those who had known the
Empecinado a poor vine-dresser, became
envious of his good fortune,
and others who envied him not, were
indignant at seeing him waste his
time in such degrading effeminacy,
instead of following up the career
which he had so nobly begun. There
was much murmuring, therefore, to
which, however, he gave little heed;
and several weeks had passed in the
manner above described, when an incident
occurred to rouse him from the
sort of lethargy in which he was sunk.</p>

<p>A despatch reached him from the
Captain-General, Don Gregorio Cuesta,
requiring his immediate presence
at Ciudad Rodrigo, there to receive
directions concerning the execution
of a service of the greatest importance,
<a class="pagenum" name="page346" id="page346" title="page346"></a>and which was to be intrusted
to him.</p>

<p>This order had its origin in circumstances
of which the Empecinado was
totally ignorant. The jeweller Barbot,
finding that neither large offers
nor threats of punishment had any
effect upon the Empecinado, who persisted
in keeping his wife prisoner,
made interest with the Duke of Infantado,
then general of one of the
Spanish armies, and besought him to
exert his influence in favour of the
captive lady, and to have her restored
to her friends. The duke, who was
a very important personage at the
court of Charles the Fourth, and the
favourite of Ferdinand the Seventh
at the beginning of his reign, entertained
a particular friendship for Barbot;
and, if the <i>chronique scandaleuse</i>
of Madrid might be believed, a still
more particular one for his wife. He
immediately wrote to General Cuesta,
desiring that the lady might be sent
back to her husband without delay, as
well as all the jewels and other spoil
that had been seized by the Empecinado.</p>

<p>With much difficulty did the guerilla
make up his mind to abandon
the inglorious position, and to go
where duty called him. Strongly
recommending his captive to his brother
and sister-in-law, he set out for
Ciudad Rodrigo, escorted by a sergeant
and ten men of his partida.
They had not proceeded half a mile
from Castrillo, when, from behind a
hedge bordering the road, a shot was
fired, and the bullet slightly wounded
the Empecinado's charger. Two of
the escort pushed their horses through
the hedge, and immediately returned,
dragging between them a grey-haired
old man, seventy years of age, who
clutched in his wrinkled fingers a
rusty carbine that had just been discharged.</p>

<p>&quot;He is surely mad!&quot; exclaimed
the Empecinado, gazing in astonishment
at the venerable assassin. &quot;<i>Dime,
viejo</i>; do you know me? And why do
you seek my life?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Si, si, te conozes</i>. You are the
Empecinado&mdash;the bloody Empecinado.
Give me back my Pedro,
whom you murdered. <i>Ay di me!
mi Pedrillo, te han matado!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>And the old man's frame quivered
with rage, as he glared on the Empecinado
with an expression of unutterable
hate.</p>

<p>One of the guerillas stepped forward&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;'Tis old Gutierrez, the father of
Pedro, who was hung in the Pi&ntilde;ares
de Coca, for betraying us to the
French.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Throw his carbine into yonder
pool, and leave the poor wretch,&quot; said
the Empecinado; &quot;his son deserved
the death he met.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He missed his aim to-day, but he
may point truer another time,&quot; said
one of the men, half drawing a pistol
from his holster.</p>

<p>&quot;Harm him not!&quot; said the Empecinado
sternly, and the party rode on.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Maldito seas</i>!&quot; screamed the old
man, casting himself in the dust of
the road, in a paroxysm of impotent
fury. &quot;<i>Maldito! Maldito! Ay de
mi! mi Pedrillo!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>And his curses and lamentations
continued till the guerillas were out
of hearing.</p>

<p>On arriving at Ciudad Rodrigo, the
Empecinado went immediately to General
Cuesta, who, although he did
not receive him unkindly, could not
but blame him greatly for the enormous
crime he had committed in carrying
off a lady who was distinguished
by so mighty a personage as the Duke
of Infantado. He told him it was absolutely
necessary to devise some plan
by which the Duke's anger might be
appeased. Murat also had sent a message
to the central junta, saying, that
if satisfaction were not given, he
would send troops to lay waste the
whole district of Penafiel, in which
Castrillo was situated; and it was
probable, that if he had not done so
already, it was because a large portion
of the inhabitants of that district were
believed to be well affected to the
French. Without exactly telling him
what he must do, the old general gave
him a despatch for the <i>corregidor</i> of
Penafiel, and desired him to present
himself before that functionary, and
concert with him the measures to be
taken.</p>

<p>The Empecinado took his leave,
and was quitting the governor's palace
when he overtook at the door an
<i>avogado</i>, who was a countryman of
his, and whom he had left at Castrillo
when he set out from that place. The
sight of this man was a ray of light to
the Empecinado, who immediately suspected
that his enemies were intriguing
against him. He proposed to the
lawyer that they should walk
<a class="pagenum" name="page347" id="page347" title="page347"></a>to the inn, to which the latter consented.
They had to traverse a lonely
place, known by the name of San
Francisco's Meadow, and on arriving
there, behind the shelter of some walls,
the Empecinado seized the advocate
by the collar, and swore he would
strangle him if he did not instantly
confess what business had brought
him to Ciudad Rodrigo, as well as all
the plans or plots against the Empecinado
to which he might be privy.</p>

<p>The lawyer, who had known Diez
from his childhood, and was fully
aware of his desperate character and
of his own peril, trembled for his life,
and besought him earnestly to use no
violence, for that he was willing to
tell all he knew. Thereupon the Empecinado
loosened his grasp, which
had wellnigh throttled the poor avogado,
and cocking a pistol, as a sort
of warning to the other to tell the
truth, bade him sit down beside him
and proceed with his narrative.</p>

<p>The lawyer informed him that the
<i>ayuntamiento</i> or corporation of Castrillo,
and those of all the towns and
villages of the district, found themselves
in great trouble on account of
the convoy he had intercepted, and
more particularly of the lady whom
he kept prisoner, and whose friends it
appeared were persons of much influence
with both contending parties, for
that the junta and the French had
alike demanded her liberty; and while
the latter were about to send troops
to put the whole country to fire and
sword, the former, as well as the Spanish
generals, had refused to afford
them any protection against the consequences
of her detention, and accused
the ayuntamiento and the priests
of encouraging the Empecinado to
hold her in captivity. He himself
had been sent to Ciudad Rodrigo to
beg General Cuesta's advice, and the
general had declared himself unable
to assist them, but recommended them
to restore the lady and treasure, if they
did not wish the French to lay waste
the country, and take by force the
bone of contention.</p>

<p>The Empecinado, suspecting that
General Cuesta had not used all due
frankness with him in this matter,
handed to the lawyer the letter that
had been given him for the corregidor
of Penafiel, and compelled him, much
against his will, to open and read it.
Its contents coincided with what the
avogado had told him; the general
advising the corregidor to use every
means to compromise the matter, rather
than wait till the French should
do themselves justice by the strong
hand.</p>

<p>Perceiving that, from various motives,
every body was against him in
this matter, the Empecinado bethought
himself how he should get out of the
scrape.</p>

<p>&quot;As an old friend and countryman,
and more especially as a lawyer,&quot;
said he to the avogado, &quot;you are the
most fitting man to give me advice in
this difficulty. Tell me, then, what I
ought to do, in order that our native
town, which is innocent in the matter,
should suffer no prejudice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You speak now like a sensible
man,&quot; replied the other, &quot;and as a
friend will I advise you. Let us immediately
set off to Penafiel, deliver
the general's letter to the corregidor,
and take him with us to Castrillo.
There, for form's sake, an examination
of your conduct in the affair can
take place. You shall give up the
jewels, the carriage, and the lady, and
set off immediately to join your partida.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To the greater part of that I willingly
agree,&quot; said the Empecinado.
&quot;The jewels are buried in the cellar,
and the carriage is in the stable.
Take both when you list. But as to
the lady, before I give her up, I will
give up my own soul. She is my
property; I took her in fair fight,
and at the risk of my life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will think better of it before
we get to Castrillo,&quot; replied the lawyer.</p>

<p>The Empecinado shook his head,
but led the way to the inn, where they
took horse, and the next day reached
Penafiel, whence they set out the following
morning for Castrillo, which is
a couple of leagues further, accompanied
by the corregidor, his secretary,
and two alguazils. The Empecinado
was induced to leave his escort at
Penafiel, in order that the sort of <i>pro
form&acirc;</i> investigation which was to be
gone through might not appear to have
taken place under circumstances of
intimidation. The avogado started a
couple of hours earlier than the rest
of the party, to have things in readiness,
so that the proceedings might be
got through as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>It was about eight o'clock on a fine
summer's morning that the Empecinado
<a class="pagenum" name="page348" id="page348" title="page348"></a>and his companions reached Castrillo.
As they entered the town, an
old mendicant, who was lying curled
up like a dog in the sunshine under
the porch of a house, lifted his head
at the noise of the horses. As his
eyes rested upon Diez, he made a
bound forward with an agility extraordinary
in one of his years, and fell
almost under the feet of the Empecinado's
horse, making the startled animal
spring aside with a violence and
suddenness sufficient to unhorse many
a less practised rider than the one who
bestrode him. The Empecinado lifted
his whip in anger, but the old man,
who had risen to his feet, showed no
sign of fear, and as he stood in the
middle of the road, and immediately
in the path of the Empecinado, the
latter recognized the wild features and
long grey hair of old Gutierrez.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Maldito seas</i>!&quot; cried the old man,
extending his arms towards the guerilla.
&quot;Murderer! the hour of vengeance
is nigh. I saw it in my dreams.
My Pedrillo showed me his assassin
trampled under the feet of horses.
<i>Asesino! Venga la hora de tu
muerte!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>And the old man, who was half
crazed by his misfortunes, relapsed
into an incoherent strain of lamentations
for his son, and curses upon him
whom he called his murderer.</p>

<p>The Empecinado, who, on recognizing
old Gutierrez, had lowered his
riding-whip, and listened unmoved to
his curses and predictions, rode forward,
explaining as he went, to the
astonished corregidor, the scene that
had just occurred. A little further on
he separated from his companions,
giving them rendezvous at ten o'clock
at the house of the ayuntamiento.
Proceeding to his brother's dwelling,
he paid a visit to Madame Barbot,
breakfasted with her, and then prepared
to keep his appointment. He
placed a brace of pistols and a poniard
in his belt, and taking a loaded <i>trabuco</i>
or blunderbuss, in his hand,
wrapped himself in his cloak so as to
conceal his weapons, and repaired to
the town-hall.</p>

<p>He found the tribunal already installed,
and every thing in readiness.
Saluting the corregidor, he began pacing
up and down the room without
taking off his cloak. The corregidor
repeatedly urged him to be seated, but
he refused, and continued his walk,
replying to the questions that were
put to him, his answers to which were
duly written down. About a quarter of
an hour had passed in this manner, when
a noise of feet and talking was heard
in the street, and the Empecinado, as
he passed one of the windows that
looked out upon the <i>plaza</i>, saw, with
no very comfortable feelings, that a
number of armed peasants were entering
the town hall. He perceived
that he was betrayed, but his presence
of mind stood his friend, and with his
usual promptitude, he in a moment
decided how he should act. Without
allowing it to appear that he had any
suspicion of what was going on, he
walked to the door of the audience
chamber, and before any one could interfere,
shut and locked it. Then
stepping up to the corregidor, he
threw off his cloak, and presented his
trabuco at the magistrate's head.</p>

<p>&quot;Se&ntilde;or Corregidor,&quot; said he, &quot;this
is not our agreement, but a base act
of treachery. Commend yourself to
God, for you are about to die.&quot;</p>

<p>The corregidor was so dreadfully
terrified at these words, and at the
menacing action of the Empecinado,
that he swooned away, and fell down
under the table&mdash;the escribano fled
into an adjoining chamber, and concealed
himself under a bed&mdash;while the
alguazils, trembling with fear, threw
themselves upon their knees, and petitioned
for mercy. The Empecinado,
finding himself with so little trouble
master of the field of battle, took possession
of the papers that were lying
upon the table, and, unlocking the
door, proceeded to the principal staircase,
which he found occupied by
inhabitants of the town, armed with
muskets and fowling-pieces. Placing
his blunderbuss under his arm, with
his hand upon the trigger, &quot;Make
way!&quot; cried he; &quot;the first who
moves a finger may reckon upon the
contents of my trabuco.&quot; His menace
and resolute character produced the
desired effect; a passage was opened,
and he left the house in triumph. On
reaching the street, however, he found
a great crowd of men, women, and
even children, assembled, who occupied
the plaza and all the adjacent
streets, and received him with loud
cries of &quot;Death to the Empecinado!
<i>Muera el ladron y mal Cristiano</i>!&quot;
The armed men whom he had left in
the town-house fired several shots at
<a class="pagenum" name="page349" id="page349" title="page349"></a>him from the windows, but nobody
dared to lay hands upon him, as he
marched slowly and steadily through
the crowd, trabuco in hand, and casting
glances on either side that made
those upon whom they fell shrink involuntarily
backwards.</p>

<p>On the low roof of one of the houses
of the plaza, that formed the angle
of the Calle de la Cruz, or street of the
cross, old Gutierrez had taken his station.
With the fire of insanity in his
bloodshot eyes, and a grin of exultation
upon his wasted features, he witnessed
the persecution of the Empecinado,
and while his ears drank in the
yells and hootings of the multitude,
he added his shrill cracked voice to
the uproar. When the shots were
fired from the town-hall, he bounded
and capered upon the platform, clapping
his meagre fingers together in
ecstasy; but as the Empecinado got
further from the house, and the firing
was discontinued, an expression of
anxiety replaced the look of triumph
that had lighted up the old maniac's
face. Diez still moved on unhurt,
and was now within a few paces of
the house on which Gutierrez had
perched himself. The old man's uneasiness
increased. &quot;Va a escapar!&quot;
muttered he to himself; &quot;they will
let him escape. Oh, if I had a gun,
my Pedrillo would soon be avenged!&quot;</p>

<p>The Empecinado was passing under
the house. A sudden thought struck
Gutierrez. Stamping with his foot,
he broke two or three of the tiles on
which he was standing, and snatching
up a large heavy fragment, he leaned
over the edge of the roof to get a full
view of the Empecinado, who was at
that moment leaving the plaza and
entering the Calle de la Cruz. In
five seconds more he would be out of
sight. As it was, it was only by leaning
very far forward that Gutierrez
could see him, walking calmly along,
and keeping at bay the angry but
cowardly mob that yelped at his heels,
like a parcel of village curs pursuing
a bloodhound, whose look alone prevents
their too near approach.</p>

<p>Throwing his left arm round a
chimney, the old man swung himself
forward, and with all the force that
he possessed, hurled the tile at the
object of his hate. The missile struck
the Empecinado upon the temple, and
he fell, stunned and bleeding, to the
ground.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Viva</i>!&quot; screamed Gutierrez; but
a cry of agony followed the shout of
exultation. The chimney by which
the old man supported himself was
loose and crumbling, and totally unfit
to bear his weight as he hung on by
it, and leaned forward to gloat over
his vengeance. It tottered for a moment,
and then fell with a crash into
the street. The height was not great,
but the pavement was sharp and uneven;
the old man pitched upon his
head, and when lifted up was already
a corpse.</p>

<p>When the mob saw the Empecinado
fall, they threw themselves upon him
with as much ferocity as they had
previously shown cowardice, and beat
and ill-treated him in every possible
manner. Not satisfied with that, they
bound him hand and foot, and pushed
him through a cellar window, throwing
after him stones, and every thing
they could find lying about the street.
At last, wearied by their own brutality,
they left him for dead, and he
remained in that state till nightfall,
when the corregidor and the ayuntamiento
proceeded to inspect his body,
in order to certify his death, and have
him buried. When he was brought
out of the cellar, however, they perceived
he still breathed, and sent for
a surgeon, and also for a priest to administer
the last sacraments. They
then carried him upon a ladder to the
<i>posito</i>, or public granary, a strong
building, where they considered he
would be in safety, and put him to
bed, bathed in blood and covered with
wounds and bruises.</p>

<p>The corregidor, fearing that the
news of the riot, and of the death of
the Empecinado, would reach Penafiel,
and that the escort which had been
left there, and the many partizans that
Diez had in that town, would come
over to Castrillo to avenge his death,
persuaded one of the cur&eacute;s or parish
priests of the latter place, to go over to
Penafiel in all haste, and, counterfeiting
great alarm, to spread the report
that the French had entered Castrillo,
seized the Empecinado, and carried
him off to Aranda. This was accordingly
done; and the Empecinado's escort
being made aware of the vicinity
of the French and the risk they ran,
immediately mounted their horses and
marched to join Mariano Fuentes, accompanied
by upwards of fifty young
men, all partizans of the Empecinado,
<a class="pagenum" name="page350" id="page350" title="page350"></a>and eager to revenge him. This matter
being arranged, the corregidor had
the jewels that were buried in the
cellar of Manuel Diez dug up, and
having taken possession of them, and
installed Madame Barbot with all due
attention in one of the principal houses
of the town, he forwarded a report to
General Cuesta of all that had occurred.
The general immediately sent
an escort to conduct the lady and the
treasure to Ciudad Rodrigo, and ordered
that as soon as the Empecinado
was in a state to be moved, he should
also be sent under a strong guard to
that city.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Empecinado's vigorous
constitution triumphed over the
injuries he had received, and he was
getting so rapidly better, that for his
safer custody the corregidor thought
it necessary to have him heavily ironed.
Deeming it impossible he should escape,
and there being no troops in the
village, no sentry was placed over him,
so that at night his friends were able
to hold discourse with him through the
grating of one of the windows of the
posito. In this manner he contrived
to send a message to his brother
Manuel, who, having also got into
trouble on account of Madame Barbot's
detention, had been compelled to
take refuge in the mountains of Bilbuena,
three leagues from Castrillo.
Manuel took advantage of a dark night
to steal into the town in disguise, and
to speak with the Empecinado. He
informed him that the superior of the
Bernardine Monastery, in the Sierra
de Balbuena, had been advised that it
was the intention of the Empecinado's
enemies to deliver him over to the
French, in order that they might shoot
him. The Empecinado replied, that
he strongly suspected there was some
such plot in agitation, and desired his
brother to seek out Mariano Fuentes,
and order him to march his band into
the neighbourhood of Castrillo, and
that on their arrival he would send
them word what to do.</p>

<p>Eight days elapsed, and the Empecinado
was now completely cured
of his wounds, so that he was in much
apprehension lest he should be sent off
to Ciudad Rodrio before the arrival
of Fuentes. On the eighth night,
however, his brother came to the window,
and informed him that the partida
was in the neighbourhood, and
only waited his orders to march upon
Castrillo, rescue him, and revenge the
treatment he had received. This the
Empecinado strongly enjoined them
not to do, but desired his brother to
come to his prison door at two o'clock
the next morning with a led horse, and
that he had the means to set himself
at liberty. Manuel Diez did as he was
ordered, wondering, however, in what
manner the Empecinado intended to
get out of the posito, which was a
solidly constructed edifice with a massive
door and grated windows. But
the next night, when the guerilla heard
the horses approaching his prison, he
seized the door by an iron bar that
traversed it on the inner side, and,
exerting his prodigious strength, tore
it off the hinges as though it had been
of pasteboard. His feet being fastened
together by a chain, he was compelled
to sit sideways upon the saddle; but
so elated was he to find himself once
more at liberty that he pushed his
horse into a gallop, and with his fetters
clanking as he went, dashed
through the streets of Castrillo, to the
astonishment and consternation of the
inhabitants, who knew not what devil's
dance was going on in their usually
quiet town.</p>

<p>At Olmos, a village a quarter of
a league from Castrillo, the fugitives
halted, and roused a smith, who
knocked off the Empecinado's irons.
After a short rest at the house of an
approved friend they remounted their
horses, and a little after daybreak
reached the place where Fuentes had
taken up his bivouac. The Empecinado
was received with great rejoicing,
and immediately resumed the
command. He passed a review of his
band, and found it consisted of two
hundred and twenty men, all well
mounted and armed.</p>

<p>Great was the alarm of the inhabitants
of Castrillo when they found the
prison broken open and the prisoner
gone; and their terror was increased
a hundred-fold, when a few hours
later news was brought that the Empecinado
was marching towards the
town at the head of a strong body of
cavalry. Some concealed themselves
in cellars and suchlike hiding-places,
others left the town and fled to the
neighbouring woods; but the majority,
despairing of escape by human means
from the terrible anger of the Empecinado,
shut themselves up in their
houses, closed the doors and windows,
<a class="pagenum" name="page351" id="page351" title="page351"></a>and prayed to the Virgin for deliverance
from the impending evil. Never
had there been seen in Castrillo such
a counting of rosaries and beating of
breasts, such genuflexions, and mumbling
of aves and paters, as upon that
morning.</p>

<p>At noon the Empecinado entered
the town at the head of his band,
trumpets sounding, and the men firing
their pistols and carbines into the air,
in sign of joy at having recovered
their leader. Forming up the partida
in the market-place, the Empecinado
sent for the corregidor and other
authorities, who presented themselves
before him pale and trembling, and
fully believing they had not five minutes
to live.</p>

<p>&quot;Fear nothing!&quot; said the Empecinado,
observing their terror. &quot;It
is certain I have met foul treatment
at your hands; and it was the harder
to bear coming from my own countrymen
and townsfolk. But you have
been misled, and will one day repent
your conduct. I have forgotten your
ill usage, and only remember the
poverty of my native town, and the
misery in which this war has plunged
many of its inhabitants.&quot;</p>

<p>So saying, he delivered to the alcalde
and the parish priests a hundred
ounces of gold for the relief of the
poor and support of the hospital, and
ten more to be spent in a <i>novillada</i>, or
bull-bait and festival for the whole
town. Cutting short their thanks
and excuses, he left Castrillo and
marched to the village of Sacramenia,
where he quartered his men, and, accompanied
by Mariano Fuentes, went
to pay a visit to a neighbouring monastery.
The monks received him
with open arms and a hearty welcome,
hailing him as the main prop
of the cause of independence in Old
Castile. They sat down to dinner in
the refectory; and the conversation
turning upon the state of the country,
the Empecinado expressed his unwillingness
to carry on the war in that
province, on account of the little confidence
he could place in the inhabitants,
so many of whom had become
<i>afrancesados</i>; and as a proof of this,
he related all that had occurred to him
at Castrillo. Upon hearing this the
abbot, who was a man distinguished
for his talents and patriotism, recommended
Diez to lead his band to New
Castile, where he would not have to
encounter the persecutions of those
who, having known him poor and insignificant,
envied him his good fortune,
and sought to throw obstacles in
his path. He offered to get him letters
from the general of the order of
San Bernardo to the superiors of the
various monasteries, in order that he
might receive such assistance and
support as they could give, and he
might chance to require.</p>

<p>&quot;No one is a prophet in his own
country,&quot; said the good father; &quot;Mahomet
in his native town of Medina
met with the same ill-treatment that
you, Martin Diez, have encountered
in the place of your birth. Abandon,
then, a province which does not recognize
your value, and go where your
reputation has already preceded you,
to defend the holy cause of Spain and
of religion.&quot;</p>

<p>Struck by the justice of this reasoning,
the Empecinado resolved to
change the scene of his operations,
and the next morning marched his
squadron in the direction of New
Castile.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="page352" id="page352" title="page352"></a>THE TALE OF A TUB: AN ADDITIONAL CHAPTER.</h2>

<h3>HOW JACK RAN MAD A SECOND TIME.</h3>

<p>After Jack and Martin parted company,
you may remember that Jack,
who had turned his face northward,
got into high favour with the landlord
of the North Farm Estate, who, being
mightily edified with his discourses
and sanctimonious demeanour, and
not aware of his having been mad
before, or being, perchance, just
as mad himself&mdash;took him in, made
much of him, gave him a cottage
upon his manor to live in, and built
him a tabernacle in which he might
hold forth when the spirit moved him.
In process of time, however, it happened
that North Farm and the Albion
Estates came into the possession of one
proprietor, Esquire Bull, in whose
house Martin had always been retained
as domestic chaplain&mdash;at least,
ever since that desperate scuffle with
Lord Peter and his crew, when he
tried to land some Spanish smugglers
on the coast, for the purpose of carrying
off Martin, and establishing himself
in Squire Bull's house in his stead.
Squire Bull, who was a man of his
word, and wished to leave all things
on North Farm as he found them,
Jack and his tabernacle included, undertook
at once to pay him a reasonable
salary, with the free use of his
house and tabernacle to him and his
heirs for ever. But knowing that on
a previous occasion, (which you may
recollect,<a name="footnotetag46" id="footnotetag46"></a><a href="#footnote46"><sup>46</sup></a>) Jack's melancholy had gone
so far that he had hanged himself,
though he was cut down just before
giving up the ghost, and by dint of
bloodletting and galvanism, had been
revived; and also that, notwithstanding
his periodical fits and hallucinations,
he could beat even Peter himself,
who had been his instructor, for
cunning and casuistry, he took care that,
before Jack was allowed to take possession
under his new lease, every thing
should be made square between them.
So he had the terms of their indenture
all written out on parchment, signed,
sealed, and delivered before witnesses,
and even got a private Act of Parliament
carried through, for the purpose
of making every thing between them
more secure. And well it was for the
Squire that he bethought himself of his
precaution in time, as you will afterwards
hear.</p>

<p>This union of the two entailed
properties in the Bull family, brought
Jack and Martin a good deal more
into one anothers' company than they
had formerly been; and 'twas clear,
that Jack, who had now got somewhat
ashamed of his threadbare raiment,
and tired of his spare oatmeal diet,
was mightily struck with the dignified
air and comfortable look of Martin,
and grudged him the frequency with
which he was invited to Squire Bull's
table. By degrees, he began to conform
his own uncouth manner to an
imitation of his. He wore a better
coat, which he no longer rubbed
against the wall to take the gloss from
off it; he ceased to interlard all his
ordinary speech with texts of Scripture;
his snuffle abated audibly; he
gave up his habit of extempore rhapsody,
and lost, in a great measure,
his aversion to Christmas tarts and
plum-pudding. After a time, he might
even be seen with a fishing-rod over
his shoulder; then he contrived sundry
improvements in gun-locks and double-barrels,
for which he took out a patent,
and in fact did not entirely escape the
suspicion of being a poacher. He
held assemblies in his house, where at
times he allowed a little singing; nay,
on one occasion, a son of his&mdash;for he
had now a large family&mdash;was found
accompanying a psalm-tune upon the
(barrel) organ, and it was rumoured
about the house, that Jack, though he
thought it prudent to disclaim this
overture, had no great objection to
it. Be that as it may, it is certain,
that instead of his old peaked hat and
band, Jack latterly took to wearing
broad-brimmed beavers, which he was
seen trying to mould into a spout-like
shape, much resembling a shovel. And
so far had the transformation gone, that
the Vicar of Fudley, meeting him one
evening walking to an assembly arrayed
<a class="pagenum" name="page353" id="page353" title="page353"></a>in a court coat, with this extraordinary
hat upon his head, and a pair
of silver buckles in his shoes, pulled
off his hat to him at a little distance,
mistaking him for a near relation of
Martin, if not for Martin himself.</p>

<p>There was no great harm you will
think in all these whims, and for my
own part, I believe that Jack was never
so honest a fellow as he was during this
time, when he was profiting by Martin's
example. He kept his own place,
ruling his family in a quiet and orderly
way, without disturbing the peace of
his neighbours: and seemed to have
forgotten his old tricks of setting people
by the ears, and picking quarrels with
constables and justices of the peace.
Howbeit, those who knew him longest
and best, always said that this was too
good to last: that with him these intervals
of sobriety and moderation
were always the prelude to a violent
access of his peculiar malady, and
that by-and-bye he would break out
again, and that there would be the
devil to pay, and no pitch hot.</p>

<p>It so happened that Squire Bull had
a good many small village schools on
his Estate of North Farm, to which the
former proprietors had always been in
the custom of appointing the ushers
themselves; and much to Jack's annoyance,
when Squire Bull succeeded, the
latter had taken care in his bargain with
him, to keep the right of appointment
to these in his own hand. But, at the
same time, he told Jack fairly, that as
he had no wish to dabble in Latin,
Greek, or school learning himself, he
left him at full liberty to say whether
those whom he appointed were fit for
the situation or not&mdash;so that if they
turned out to be ignoramuses, deboshed
fellows, or drunken dogs, Jack
had only to say so on good grounds,
and they were forthwith sent adrift.
Matters went on for a time very
smoothly on this footing. Nay, it was
even said that Jack was inclined to
carry his complaisance rather far, and
after a time seldom troubled himself
much about the usher's qualifications,
provided his credentials were all right.
He might ask the young fellow, who
presented John's commission, perhaps,
what was the first letter of the
Greek alphabet? what was Latin for
beef and greens? or where Moses was
when the candle was blown out?&mdash;but
if the candidate answered these questions
correctly, and if there were no
scandal or <i>fama clamosa</i> against him,
as Jack in his peculiar jargon expressed
it, he generally shook hands with him
at once, put the key of the schoolhouse
in his hand, and told him civilly
to walk up-stairs.</p>

<p>The truth was, however, that in
this respect Jack had little reason to
complain; for though the Squire, in the
outset, may not have been very particular
as to his choice, and it was said
once or twice gave an ushership to an
old exciseman, on account of his skill
in mensuration of fluids, he had latterly
become very particular, and
would not hear of settling any body
as schoolmaster on North Farm,
who did not come to him with an
excellent character, certified by two
or three respectable householders at
least. But, strangely enough, it was
observed that just in proportion as the
Squire became more considerate, Jack
became more arrogant, pestilent, and
troublesome. Now-a-days he was always
discovering some objection to the
Squire's appointments: one usher, it
seemed, spoke too low, another too loud,
one used an ear-trumpet, another a pair
of grass-green spectacles; one had
no sufficient gifts for flogging; another
flogged either too high or too
low&mdash;(for Jack was like the deserter,
there was no pleasing him as to the
mode of conducting the operation;)
and, finally, another was rejected because
he was unacquainted with the
vernacular of Ossian&mdash;to the great
injury and damage, as was alleged, of
two Highland chairmen, who at an
advanced period of life were completing
their education in the school in
question. At first Squire Bull, honest
gentleman, had given in to these
strange humours on the part of Jack,
believing that this new-born zeal on
his part was in the main conscientious,
though he could not help thinking it
at times sufficiently whimsical and preposterous.
He had even gone so far,
occasionally, as to send Jack a list of
those to whom he proposed giving
the usherships, accompanied with a
polite note, in some such terms as
these, &quot;Squire Bull presents his respects,
and begs his good friend Jack
will read over the enclosed list, and
take the trouble of choosing for himself;&quot;
a request with which Jack was
always ready to comply. And, further,
as Jack had always a great hankering
after little-goes and penny subscriptions
<a class="pagenum" name="page354" id="page354" title="page354"></a>of every kind, and was eternally
trumpeting forth some new nostrum
or <i>scheme</i> of this kind, as he used to
call it, the Squire had been prevailed
upon to purchase from him a good
many tickets for these schemes from
time to time, for which he always
paid in hard cash, though I have never
heard that any of them turned up
prizes, except it may have been to
Jack himself.</p>

<p>Jack, as we have said, grew bolder
as the Squire became more complying,
thinking that, in the matter of
these appointments, as he had once
got his hand in, it would be his own
fault if he could not contrive to
wriggle in his whole body. It so happened,
too, that just about the very
time that one of John's usherships became
vacant, one of those atrabilious
and hypochondriac fits came over Jack,
with which, as we have said, he was periodically
afflicted, and which, though
they certainly unsettled his brain a
little, only served, as in the case of
other lunatics, to render him, during
the paroxysm, more cunning, inventive,
and mischievous. After
moving about in a moping way for
a day or two&mdash;mumbling in corners,
and pretending to fall on his knees,
in his old fashion, in the midst of
the street, he suddenly got up, flung
his broad-brimmed beaver into the
kennel, trampled his wig in the dirt,
so as to expose his large ears as
of old, ran home, pulled his rusty
black doublet out of the chest where it
had lain for years, squeezing it on as
he best could&mdash;for he had got somewhat
corpulent in the mean time&mdash;and
thus transfigured, he set out to consult
the village attorney, with whom
it was observed he remained closeted
for several hours, turning over Burns'
Justice, and perusing an office-copy
of his indenture with the Squire&mdash;a
planetary conjunction from which
those who were astrologically given
boded no good.</p>

<p>What passed between these worthies
on this occasion&mdash;whether the
attorney really persuaded Jack that,
if he set about it, he would undertake
to find him a flaw in his contract with
Squire Bull, which would enable him
to take the matter of the usherships
into his own hand, and to do as he
pleased; or whether Jack&mdash;as he
seemed afterwards to admit in private&mdash;believed
nothing of what the attorney
told him, but was resolved to take
advantage of the Squire's good-nature,
and to run all risks as to the result, 'tis
hard to say. Certain it was, however,
that Jack posted down at once from
the attorney's chamber to the village
school, which happened to be then
vacant, and gathering the elder boys
about him, he told them he had reason
to believe the Squire was about to
send them another usher, very different
from the last, who was a mortal
enemy to marbles, pitch-and-toss,
chuck-farthing, ginger-bread, and
half holydays; with a corresponding
liking to long tasks and short commons;
that the use of the cane would
be regularly taught, along with that of
the globes, accompanied with cuts and
other practical demonstrations; that
the only chance of escaping this visitation
was to take a bold line, and
show face to the usher at once, since
otherwise the chance was, that at no
distant period they might be obliged
to do the very reverse.</p>

<p>Jack further reasoned the matter with
the boys learnedly, somewhat in this
fashion&mdash;&quot;That as no one could have
so strong an interest in the matter, so
no one could be so good a judge of
the qualifications of the schoolmaster
as the schoolboy; that the close and
intimate relation between these parties
was of the nature of a mutual contract,
in the formation of which both had an
equal right to be consulted; so that,
without mutual consent, or, as it
were, a harmonious call by the boys,
there could be no valid ushership, but
a mere usurpation of the power of the
tawse, and unwarrantable administration
of the birchen twig; that, further,
this latter power involved a
fundamental feature, in which they
could not but feel they had all a deep
interest&mdash;and which, he might say,
lay at the bottom of the whole question;
that he himself perfectly remembered
that, in former days, the schoolboys
had always exercised this privilege,
which he held to be equally
salutary and constitutional; and that
he would, at his leisure, show them a
private memorandum-book of his own,
in which, though he had hitherto said
nothing about it, he had found an entry
to that effect made some thirty years
before. In short, he told them, if
they did not wish to be rode over
rough-shod, they must stand up boldly
for themselves, and try to get all the
<a class="pagenum" name="page355" id="page355" title="page355"></a>schools in the neighbourhood to join
them, if necessary, in a regular barring-out,
or general procession, in
which they were to appear with flags
and banners, bearing such inscriptions
as the following: &quot;<i>Pro aris et focis</i>&quot;&mdash;&quot;Liberty
is like the air we breathe,&quot;
&amp;c. &amp;c., and, lastly, in large gilt
capitals&mdash;&quot;<i>No usher to be intruded into
any school contrary to the will of the
scholars in schoolroom assembled</i>.&quot; And,
in short, that this process was to be
repeated until they succeeded in getting
quit of Squire Bull's usher, and
getting an usher who would flog them
with all the forbearance and reserve
with which Sancho chastised his own
flesh while engaged in the process of
disenchanting Dulcinea del Toboso.
At the same time, with that cunning
which was natural to him, Jack took
care to let the scholars know that
<i>his</i> name was not to be mentioned in
the transaction; and that, if they
were asked any questions, they must
be prepared to say, nay, to swear, for
that matter, that they objected to
John's usher from no personal dislike
to the man himself, and without having
received fee or reward, in the shape of
apples, lollypops, gingerbread, barley-sugar,
or sweetmeats whatever&mdash;or
sixpences, groats, pence, halfpence, or
other current coin of the realm.</p>

<p>It will be readily imagined that this
oration of Jack, pronounced as it was
with some of his old unction, and accompanied
with that miraculous and
subtle twist of the tongue which
we have described in a former chapter,<a name="footnotetag47" id="footnotetag47"></a><a href="#footnote47"><sup>47</sup></a>
produced exactly the effect upon
his audience which might be expected.
The boys were delighted&mdash;tossed up
their caps&mdash;gave Jack three cheers,
and told him if he stood by them they
would stand by him, and that they
were much mistaken if they did not
contrive to make the schoolhouse too
hot for any usher whom Squire Bull
might think fit to send them.</p>

<p>It happened not long after, as Jack
had anticipated, that one morning a
young man called upon with a letter
from the Squire, intimating that he
had named him to the vacant ushership;
and requesting Jack to examine
into his qualifications as usual. Jack
begged him to be seated, and (having
privately sent a message to the schoolboys)
continued to entertain him with
enquiries as to John's health and the
state of the weather, till he heard, by
the noise in the court, that the boys
had arrived. In they marched accordingly,
armed with horn-books,
primers, slates, rulers, Gunter's-scales,
and copy-books, taking up their station
near the writing-desk. The young
usher-elect, though he thought this a
whimsical exhibition, supposed that
the urchins had been brought there
only to do honour to his examination,
and accordingly begged Jack, as he
was in a hurry, to proceed. &quot;Fair and
softly, young man,&quot; said Jack, in his
blandest tones; &quot;we must first see what
these intelligent young gentlemen
have got to say to that. Tom, my
fine fellow, here is a gentleman sent
by Squire Bull to be your usher.
What do you say to him?&quot; &quot;I don't
like him,&quot; said Tom. &quot;May I venture
to ask why?&quot; said the usher,
putting in a word. &quot;Don't like him,&quot;
repeated Tom. &quot;Don't like him neither,&quot;
said Dick. &quot;And no mistake,&quot;
added Peter, with a grin, which immediately
circulated round the school.
&quot;It is quite impossible,&quot; said Jack,
&quot;under existing circumstances, that the
matter can proceed any further; it is
plain the school can never be edified
by such an usher. But, stop, that
there may be no misconception on the
subject. Here you, Smith&mdash;do you
really mean to say, on soul and conscience,
you don't think this respectable
gentleman can do you any good?&quot;
Of course, Smith stated that his mind
was quite made up on the subject.
&quot;Come here, Jenkins,&quot; said Jack,
beckoning to another boy; &quot;tell the
truth now&mdash;honour bright, remember.
Has any body given or promised you
any apples, parliament, or other
sweetmeat unknown, to induce you to
vote against the usher?&quot; Jenkins,
who had just wiped his lips of the last
remains of a gingerbread cake, which
somehow or other had dropped into
his pocket by accident, protested, on
his honour, that he was quite above
such a thing, and was, in fact, actuated
purely by a conscientious zeal for
the cause of flogging all over the
world. &quot;The scruples of these intelligent
and ingenuous youths,&quot; said
John, turning to the usher, &quot;must,
<a class="pagenum" name="page356" id="page356" title="page356"></a>in conscience, receive effect; the law,
as laid down in my copy of Squire
Bull's own contract, is this&mdash;'That
noe ushere be yntruded intoe anie
schoole against ye wille of ye schooleboys
in schoole-roome assembled.'
So, with your permission, we will adjourn
the consideration of the case
till the Greek Calends, or latter Lammas,
if that be more convenient.&quot; And,
so saying, he left John's letter lying on
the table, and shut the schoolroom
door in the face of the astonished usher.</p>

<p>Squire Bull, as may be imagined,
was not a little astonished and mortified
at hearing from the usher, who
returned looking foolish and chop-fallen,
of this outbreak on the part of
Jack, for whom he had really begun
to conceive a sort of sneaking kindness;
but knowing of old his fantastical
and melancholic turn, he attributed
this sally rather to the state of his
bowels, which at all times he exceedingly
neglected, and which, being
puffed up with flatulency and indigestion
to an extraordinary degree, not
unfrequently acted upon his brain&mdash;generating
therein strange conceits
and dangerous hallucinations&mdash;than
to any settled intention on Jack's part
to pick a quarrel with him or evade
performance of the conditions of their
indenture, so long as he was not under
the influence of hypochondria. And
having this notion as to Jack's motives,
and knowing nothing of the
private confab at the village lawyer's,
he could not help believing that, by a
brisk course of purgatives and an antiphlogistic
treatment&mdash;and without
resorting to a strait-waistcoat, which
many who knew Jack's pranks at once
recommended him to adopt&mdash;he might
be cured of those acrid and intoxicating
vapours, which, ascending into
the brain, led him into such extravagant
vagaries. &quot;I'faith,&quot; said the
Squire, &quot;since the poor man has
taken this mad fancy into his head
as to the terms of his bargain, the
best way to restore him to his senses
is to bring the matter, as he himself
seemed to desire it, before the Justices
of the Peace at once: 'Tis a hundred
to one but he will have come
to his senses long before they have
come to a decision; at all events,
unless he is madder than I take him
to be, when he finds how plain the
terms of the indenture are, he will
surely submit with a good grace.'&quot;</p>

<p>So thought the Squire; and, accordingly,
by his direction, the usher-elect
brought his case before the Justices at
their next sittings, who forthwith summoned
Jack before them to know why
he refused performance of his contract
with the Squire. Jack came on the
day appointed, attended by the attorney&mdash;though
for that matter he might
have safely left him behind, being
fully as much master of all equivocation
or chicanery as if he had never
handled anything but quills and quirks
from his youth upward. This, indeed,
was probably the effect of his old
training in Peter's family, for whose
hairsplitting distinctions and Jesuistical
casuistries, notwithstanding his
dislike to the man himself, he had a
certain admiration, founded on a secret
affinity of nature. Indeed it was
wonderful to observe how, with all
Jack's hatred to Peter, real or pretended,
he took after him in so many
points&mdash;insomuch that at times, their
look, voice, manner, and way of thinking,
were so closely alike, that those
who knew them best might very well
have mistaken them for each other.
The usher having produced the Squire's
copy of the indenture, pointed out the
clause by which Jack became bound
to examine and admit to the schools
on North Farm any qualified usher
whom the Squire might send&mdash;as the
condition on which he was to retain
his right to the tabernacle and his
own mansion upon the Farm&mdash;at the
same time showing Jack's seal and
signature at the bottom of the deed.
Jack, being called upon by the justices
to show cause, pulled out of his
pocket an old memorandum-book&mdash;very
greasy, musty, and ill-flavoured&mdash;and
which, from the quantity of dust
and cobwebs with which it was overlaid,
had obviously been lying on the
shelf for half a century at least. This
he placed in the hands of his friend
Snacks the attorney, pointing out to
him a page or two which he had
marked with his thumb nail, as appropriate
to the matter in hand. And
there, to be sure, was to be found,
among a quantity of other nostrums,
recipes, cooking receipts, prescriptions,
and omnium-gatherums of all
kinds, an entry to this effect:&mdash;&quot;That
no ushere be yntruded intoe anie
schoole against ye wille of ye schooleboys
in schoole-roome assembled.&quot;
Whereupon the attorney maintained,
<a class="pagenum" name="page357" id="page357" title="page357"></a>that, as this memorandum-book of
Jack's was plainly of older date than
the indenture, and had evidently been
seen by the Squire at or prior to the
time of signing, as appeared from some
of the entries which it contained being
incorporated in the deed, it must
be presumed, that its whole contents,
though not to be found in the
indenture <i>per expressum</i>, or <i>totidem
verbis</i>, were yet included therein <i>implicitly</i>,
or in a latent form, inasmuch
as they were not <i>per expressum</i> excluded
therefrom;&mdash;this being, as you
will recollect, precisely the argument
which Jack had borrowed from Peter,
when the latter construed their father's
will in the question as to the
lawfulness of their wearing shoulder-knots;
and very much of the same
kind with that celebrated thesis which
Peter afterwards maintained in the
matter of the brown loaf. And though
he was obliged to admit (what indeed
from the very look of the book he
could not well dispute) that no such
rule had ever been known or acted
upon&mdash;and on the contrary that Jack,
until this last occasion, had always
admitted the Squire's ushers without
objection whatsoever; yet he contended
vehemently, that now that his
conscience was awakened on the subject,
the past must be laid out of view;
and that the old memorandum-book,
as part and parcel of the indenture
itself, must receive effect; and farther,
that whether he, Jack, was right
or wrong in this matter, the Justices
had no right to interfere with them.</p>

<p>But the Justices, on looking into this
antiquated document, found that, besides
this notandum, the memorandum-book
contained a number of other entries
of a very extraordinary kind&mdash;such,
for instance, as that Martin was
no better than he should be, and ought
to be put down speedily: that Squire
Bull had no more right to nominate
ushers than he had to be Khan of Tartary:
that that right belonged exclusively
to Jack himself, or to the schoolboys
under Jack's control and direction:
that Jack was to have the sole
right of laying down rules for his own
government, and of enforcing them
against himself by the necessary compulsitors,
if the case should arise; thus,
that Jack should have full powers to
censure, fine, punish, flog, flay, banish,
imprison, or set himself in the stocks
as often as he should think fit; but
that whether Jack did right or wrong,
in any given case, Jack was himself
to be the sole judge, and neither
Squire Bull nor any of his Justices of
the Peace was to have one word to
say to him or his proceedings in the
matter: on the contrary, that any
such interference on their part, was
to be regarded as a high grievance
and misdemeanour on their part, for
which Jack was to be entitled at the
least to read them a lecture from the
writing-desk, and shut the schoolroom
door in their own or their children's
face.</p>

<p>There were many other whimsical
and extravagant things contained in
this private note-book, so much so,
that it was evident no man in his senses
could ever have intended to make them
part of his bargain with Jack. But
the matter was put beyond a doubt
by the usher producing the original
draft of the indenture, on which some
of these crotchets, including this fancy
about the right of the schoolboys to
reject the usher if they did not like
him, had been <i>interlined</i> in Jack's
hand: but all of which the Squire, on
revising the deed, had scored out with
his own pen, adding in the margin,
opposite to the very passage, the
words, in italics&mdash;&quot;<i>See him damned
first.&mdash;J.B.</i>&quot; And as it could not
be disputed that Jack and the Squire
ultimately subscribed the deed, omitting
all this nonsense&mdash;the Justices had
no hesitation in holding, that Jack's
private memorandum-book, even if he
had always carried it in his breeches
pocket, and quoted it on all occasions,
instead of leaving it&mdash;as it was plain
he had done&mdash;for many a long year, in
some forgotten corner of his trunk
or lumber-room, could no more affect
the construction of the indenture
between himself and Squire, or
afford him any defence against performance
of his part of that indenture, than
if he had founded on the statutes of
Prester John, on the laws of Hum-Bug,
Fee-Faw-Fum, or any other
Emperor of China for the time being.
And so, after hearing very deliberately
all that the attorney for Jack had to
say to the contrary, they decided that
Jack must forthwith proceed to examine
the usher, and give him possession,
if qualified, of the schoolhouse
and other appurtenances; or
else make up his mind to a thundering
action of damages if he did not.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page358" id="page358" title="page358"></a>The Justices thought that Jack, on
hearing the case fairly stated, and
their opinion given against him, with
a long string of cases in point, would
yield, and give the usher possession
in the usual way; but no: no sooner
was the sentence written out than Jack
entered an appeal to the Quarter-sessions.
There the whole matter was
heard over again, at great length, before
a full bench; but after Jack and
his attorney had spoken till they were
tired, the Quarter-sessions, without a
moment's hesitation, confirmed the
sentence of the Justices, with costs.</p>

<p>Jack, who had blustered exceedingly
as to his chances of bamboozling
the Quarter-sessions, and quashing
the sentence of the Justices, looked
certainly not a little discomfited at the
result of his appeal. For some days
after, he was observed to walk about
looking gloomy and disheartened, and
was heard to say to some of his family,
that he began to think matters had
really gone too far between him and
his good friend the Squire, to whom
he owed his bread; that, on second
thoughts, he would give up the point
about intruding ushers on the schools,
and see whether the Squire might not
be prevailed on to arrange matters on
an amicable footing; and that he
would take an opportunity, the next
time he had an assembly at his house,
of consulting his friends on the subject.
And had Jack stuck to this resolution,
there is little doubt that, by
some device or other, he would have
gained all he wanted; for the Squire,
being an easy, good-natured man, and
wishing really to do his duty in the
matter of the ushership, would probably,
if Jack had yielded in this instance
with a good grace, have probably
allowed him in the end to have
things very much his own way. But
to the surprise of everybody, the next
time Jack had a party of friends with
him, he rose up, and putting on that
peculiarly sanctimonious expression
which his countenance generally assumed
when he had a mind to confuse
and mystify his auditors by a string
of enigmas and Jesuitical reservations,
made a long, unintelligible, and inconsistent
harangue, the drift of which
no one could well understand, except
that it bore that &quot;both the Justices and
the Quarter-sessions were a set of ignoramuses
who could not understand
a word of Jack's contract, and knew
nothing of black-letter whatever; but
that, nevertheless, as they had decided
against him, he, as a loyal subject,
must and would submit;&mdash;not, however,
that he had the least idea of taking
the Squire's usher, or any other usher
whatsoever, on trials, contrary to the
schoolboys' wishes; <i>that</i>, he begged to
say, he would never hear of:&mdash;still he
would obey the law by laying no claim
himself to the usher's salary, nor interfering
with the usher's drawing it; and
yet that he could not exactly answer for
others not doing so;&quot;&mdash;Jack knowing
all the time, that, claim as he might,
he himself had no more right to the salary
than to the throne of the Celestial
Empire; while, on the other hand, by
locking up the schoolroom, and keeping
the key in his pocket, he had rendered
it impossible for the poor wight
of an usher to recover one penny of it&mdash;the
legal condition of his doing so being
his actual possession of the schoolhouse
itself, of which Jack, by this last man&oelig;uvre,
had contrived to deprive him.
But, as if to finish the matter, and to
prove the knavish spirit in which this
protestation was made, he instantly
got a <i>private</i> friend and relative of his
own, with whom the whole scheme
had been arranged beforehand, to
come forward and bring an action on
the case, in which the latter claimed
the whole fund which would have belonged
to the unlucky usher&mdash;in terms,
as he said, of some old arrangement
made by the Squire's predecessor as to
school-salaries during vacancy; to be
applied, as the writ very coolly stated
it, &quot;for behoof of Jack's destitute widow,
in the event of his decease, and
of his numerous and indigent family.&quot;</p>

<p>Many of Jack's own family, who
were present on this occasion, remonstrated
with him on the subject, foreseeing
that if he went on as he had
begun and threatened to proceed, he
must soon come to a rupture with the
Squire, which could end in nothing
else than his being turned out of house
and hall, and thrown adrift upon the
wide world, without a penny in his
pocket. But the majority&mdash;who were
puffed up with more than Jack's own
madness and had a notion that by
sheer boldness and bullying on their
part, the Squire would, after a time,
be sure to give way, encouraged Jack
to go on at all hazards, and not to retract
a hair's breadth in his demands.
And Jack, who had now become mischievously
<a class="pagenum" name="page359" id="page359" title="page359"></a>crazed on the subject, and
began to be as arrogant and conceited
of his own power and authority, as
ever my Lord Peter had been in his
proudest and most pestilential days,
was not slow to follow their advice.</p>

<p>'Twas of no consequence that a
friend of the Squire's, who had known
Jack long, and had really a great kindness
towards him, tried to bring about
an arrangement between him and the
Squire upon very handsome terms.
He had a meeting with Jack;&mdash;at
which he talked the matter over in a
friendly way&mdash;telling him that though
the Squire must reserve in his own
hands the nomination of his own ushers,
he had always been perfectly willing
to listen to reason in any objections
that might be taken to them;
only some reason he must have, were
it only that Jack could not abide
the sight of a red-nosed usher:&mdash;let
that reason, such as it was, be put on
paper, and he would consider of it;
and if, from any peculiar idiosyncracy
in Jack's temperament and constitution,
he found that his antipathy to
red noses was unsuperable, probably
he would not insist on filling up the
vacancy with a nose of that colour.
Jack, who was always more rational
when alone than when he had got the
attorney and the more frantic members
of his family at his elbow, acknowledged,
as he well might, that all
this seemed very reasonable; and that
he really thought that on these terms
the Squire and he would have little
difficulty in coming to an agreement.
So they parted, leaving the Squire's
friend under the impression that all
was right, and that he had only to get
an agreement to that effect drawn out,
signed and sealed by the parties.</p>

<p>Next morning, however, he received
a letter by the penny-post, written no
doubt in Jack's hand, but obviously
dictated by the attorney, in these
terms:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blkquot"><p>&quot;Honoured Sir&mdash;Lest there should
be any misconception between us as
to our yesterday's conversation, I
have put into writing the substance
of what was agreed on between us,
which I understand to be this: that
there shall be no let or impediment to
the Squire's full and absolute right of
naming an usher in all cases of vacancy;
that I shall have an equally
full right to object to the said usher
for any reasons that may be satisfactory
to myself, and thereupon to exclude
him from the school; leaving it
to the Squire, if he pleases, to send
another, whom I shall have the right
of handling in the same fashion, with
this further proviso, that if the Squire
does not fill up the office to my satisfaction
within half-a-year, I shall
be entitled to take the appointment
into my own hands. I need hardly
add that no Justices of the Peace are to
take cognizance of anything done by
me in the matter, be it good, bad, or
indifferent. Hoping that this statement
of our mutual views will be
found correct and satisfactory&mdash;I remain,
your humble servant,</p>

<p>&quot;JACK.&quot;</p></div>

<p>The moment the Squire's friend
perused this missive, he saw plainly
that all hope of bringing Jack to his
senses was at an end; and that under
the advice of evil counsellors, lunatic
friends, and lewd fellows of the baser
sort, Jack would shortly bring himself
and his family to utter ruin.</p>

<p>And now, as might be expected, Jack's
disorder, which had hitherto been comparatively
of the calm and melancholy
kind, broke out into the most violent and
phrenetic exhibitions. He sometimes
raved incoherently, for hours together,
against the Squire; often, in the midst
of his speeches, he was assailed with
epileptic fits, during which he displayed
the strangest contortions and
most laughable gestures; he threw entirely
aside the decent coat he had
worn for some time back, and habitually
attired himself in the old and
threadbare raiment, which he had worn
after he and Martin had been so unceremoniously
sent to the right-about
by Lord Peter, and even ran about
the streets with his band tied round
his peaked beaver, bearing thereon
the motto&mdash;&quot;<i>Nemo me impune lacessit</i>.&quot;
If his madness had only
led him to make a spectacle and laughing-stock
of himself, by these wild
vagaries and mountebank exhibitions,
all had been well, but this did not satisfy
Jack; his old disposition for a
riot had returned, and a riot, right or
wrong, he was determined to have.
So he set to work to frighten the
women of the village with stories, as
to the monsters whom the Squire would
send among them as ushers, who
would do nothing but teach their
<a class="pagenum" name="page360" id="page360" title="page360"></a>children drinking, chuck-farthing, and
cock-fighting; to the schoolboys
themselves, talked of the length,
breadth, and thickness, of the usher's
birch, which he assured them was
dipped in vinegar every evening, in
order to afford a more agreeable stimulus
to the part affected; he plied
them with halfpence and strong beer;
exhorted them to insurrections and
barrings-out; taught them how to
mock at any usher who would not submit
to be Jack's humble servant; and
by gibes and scurril ballads, which he
would publish in the newspapers, try to
make his life a burden to him. He also
instructed them how best to stick darts
into his wig, cover his back with
spittle, fill his pockets with crackers,
burn assaf&oelig;tida in the fire, extinguish
the candles with fulminating
powder, or blow up the writing-desk
by a train of combustibles. Above
all, he counselled the urchins to stand
firm the next time that John sent an
usher down to that quarter, and vehemently
to protest for the doctrine of
election as to their own usher, and reprobation
as to the Squire's; assuring
them, that provided they took his advice,
and followed the plan which he would
afterwards impart to them in confidence
at the proper time, he could almost
take it upon himself to say, that
in a short time, no tyrannical usher,
or cast-off tutor of the Squire, should
venture to show his face, with or without
tawse or ferule, within the boundaries
of North Farm.</p>

<p>It was not long before an opportunity
offered of putting these precious
schemes in practice; for shortly afterwards,
the old usher of a school on the
northermost boundary of the North
Farm estates having died, the ushership
became vacant, and John, as usual,
appointed a successor in his room.
Being warned this time by what had
taken place on the last occasion, the
Squire took care to apply beforehand
to the Justices of the Peace&mdash;got
a peremptory <i>mandamus</i> from them,
directing Jack to proceed forthwith,
and, after the usual trials, to put the
usher in possession of the schoolhouse
by legal form, and without re-regard
to any protest or interruption
from any or all of the schoolboys
put together. So down the usher
proceeded, accompanied by a posse
of constables and policemen of various
divisions, till they arrived at the
schoolhouse, which lay adjacent to
the churchyard, and then demanded
admittance. It happened that in this
quarter resided some of Jack's family,
who, as we have already mentioned,
differed from him entirely, thinking him
totally wrong in the contest with the
Squire and being completely satisfied
that all his glosses upon his contract
were either miserable quibbles or mere
hallucinations, and that it was his duty,
so long as he ate John's bread, and
slept under John's roof, to perform
fairly the obligations he had come
under:&mdash;and so, on reading the Justices'
warrant, which required them,
on pain of being set in the stocks, and
forfeiture of two shillings and sixpence
of penalty, besides costs, to give immediate
possession to the Squire's
usher, they at once resolved to obey,
called for the key of the schoolhouse,
and proceeded to the door,
accompanied by the usher and the authorities,
for the purpose of complying
with the warrant and admitting the
usher as in times past. But on arriving
there, never was there witnessed
such a scene of confusion. The
churchyard was crowded with ragamuffins
of every kind, from all the neighbouring
parishes; scarcely was there
a sot or deboshed fellow within the
district who had not either come himself
or found a substitute; gipsies, beggarwomen,
and thimbleriggers were
thick as blackberries; while Jack himself&mdash;who,
upon hearing of what was
going forward, had come down by the
night coach with all expedition&mdash;was
standing on a tombstone near the doorway,
and holding forth to the whole bevy
of rascals whom he had assembled about
him. It was evident from his tones and
gestures that Jack had been exciting
the mob in every possible way; but as
the justices and the constables drew
near, he changed the form of his
countenance, pulled a psalm-book out
of his pocket, and, with much sanctity
and appearance of calmness, gave out
the tune; in which the miscellaneous
assemblage around him joined, with
similar unction and devotion. When
the procession reached the door, they
found the whole inside of the schoolhouse
already packed with urchins
and blackguards of all kinds, who,
having previously gained admission
by the window, had forcibly barricaded
the door against the constables,
being assisted in the defence thereof
<a class="pagenum" name="page361" id="page361" title="page361"></a>by the mob without, who formed a
double line, and kept hustling the poor
usher and the constables from side to
side, helping themselves to a purse or
two in passing, and calling out at the
same time, &quot;take care of pickpockets&quot;&mdash;occasionally
amusing themselves also
by playfully smashing the beaver of
some of the justices of the peace over
their face, to the tune of &quot;all round
my hat,&quot; sung in chorus, on the Mainzerian
system, amidst peals of laughter.</p>

<p>Meantime Jack was skipping up
and down upon the tombstone, calling
out to his myrmidons&mdash;&quot;Good
friends! Sweet friends! Let me not
stir your spirits up to mutiny. Though
that cairn of granite stones lies very
handy and inviting, I pray you refrain
from it. Touch it not. I humbly
entreat my friend with the dirty shirt
not to break the sconce of the respectable
gentleman whom I have in
my eye, with that shillelah of his&mdash;though
I must admit that he is labouring
under strong and just provocation.&quot;
&quot;For mercy's sake, my dear sir!&quot;
he would exclaim to a third&mdash;&quot;don't
push my respected friend the justice
into yonder puddle&mdash;the one which
lies so convenient on your right hand
there; though, to be sure, the ground
<i>is</i> slippery, and the thing <i>might</i> happen,
in a manner without any one's
being able to prevent it.&quot; And so
on he went, taking care to say nothing
for which the justices could afterwards
venture to commit him to
Bridewell; but, in truth, stirring up
the rabble to the utmost, by nods,
looks, winks, and covert speeches, intended
to convey exactly the opposite
meaning from what the words bore.</p>

<p>At last by main force, and after a
hard scuffle, the constables contrived
to force the schoolhouse door open,
and so to make way for the justices,
the usher, and those of Jack's family
who, as we have seen already, had
made up their minds to give the usher
possession, to enter. But having entered,
the confusion and bedevilment
was ten times worse than even in the
churchyard itself. The benches were
lined with a pack of overgrown rascals
in corduroy vestments, and with
leather at the knees, from all the
neighbouring villages; in a gallery
at one end sat a Scotch bagpiper,
flanked by a blind fiddler, and an itinerant
performer on the hurdygurdy,
accompanied by his monkey&mdash;who in
the course of his circuit through the
village, had that morning received a
special retainer, in the shape of half a
quartern of gin, for the occasion; while
in the usher's chair were ensconced
two urchins of about fourteen years
of age, smoking tobacco, playing at all
fours, and drinking purl, with their
legs diffused in a picturesque attitude
along the writing-desk. One of the
justices tried to command silence&mdash;till
the Squire's commission to the
usher should be read; but no sooner
had he opened his mouth than the
whole multitude burst forth as if the
confusion of tongues had taken place
for the first time; twenty spoke together,
ten whistled, as many more
sang psalms and obscene songs alternately;
the bagpiper droned his
worst; the fiddler uttered notes that
made the hair of those who heard
them stand on end; while the hurdygurdy
man did his utmost to grind
down both his companions, in which
task he was ably assisted by the grinning
and chattering of the honourable
and four-footed gentleman on his
left. Meantime stones, tiles, and
rafters, pewter pint-pots, fragments
of slates, rulers, and desks, were circulating
through the schoolhouse in
all directions, in the most agreeable
confusion.</p>

<p>One of the justices tried to speak,
but even from the first it was all
dumb show; and scarcely had he proceeded
through two sentences, when
his oration was extinguished as suddenly
and by the same means as the
conflagration of the Royal Palace at
Lilliput. After many attempts to
obtain a hearing, it became obvious
that all chance of doing so in the
schoolhouse was at an end; and so
the usher, the justices, and the rest,
adjourned to the next ale-house, where
they had the usher's commission
quietly read over in presence of the
landlord and the waiter, and handed
him over the keys of the house before
the same witnesses; of all which, and
of their previous deforcement by a
mob of rapscallions, they took care to
have an instrument regularly drawn
out by a notary-public. Thereafter
they ordered a rump and dozen, being
confident that as the day was bitterly
cold, and the snow some feet deep
upon the ground, the courage of the
rioters would be cooled before they
<a class="pagenum" name="page362" id="page362" title="page362"></a>had finished dinner; and so it was,
for towards evening, the temperature
having descended considerably beneath
the freezing point, the mob, who had
now exhausted their beer and gin, and
who saw that there was no more fun
to be expected for the day, began
to disperse each man to his home, so
that before nightfall the coast was
clear; on which the justices, with the
<i>posse comitatus</i>, escorted the usher to
the schoolhouse, opened the door,
put him formally in possession, and,
wishing him much good of his new
appointment, departed.</p>

<p>But how did Jack, you will ask, bear
this rebuff on the part of his own kin?
Why, very ill indeed; in truth, he
became furious, and seemed to have
lost all natural feelings towards his
own flesh and blood. He summoned
such of his family as had given admission
to the usher before him, called a
sort of court-martial of the rest of his
relations to enquire into their conduct;
and, notwithstanding the
accused protested that they had the highest
respect and regard for Jack,
were his humble servants to command
in all ordinary matters, and only
acted in this instance in obedience
to the justices' warrant, (the which, if
they had disobeyed, they were certain
to have been at that moment cooling
their heels in the stocks,) Jack, who
was probably worked up to a kind of
frenzy by his more violent of his
inmates, kicked them out of the room,
and sent a set of his myrmidons after
them, with instructions to tear their
coats off their backs, strip them of
their wigs and small-clothes, and turn
them into the street. Against this the
unlucky wights appealed to the justices
for protection, who, to be sure,
sent down some policemen, who beat
off the mob, and enabled them to make
their doors fast against Jack and his
emissaries. But beyond that they
could give them little assistance; for
though Jack and his abettors could
not actually venture upon a trespass
by forcing their way within doors,
they contrived to render the very
existence of all who were not of their
way of thinking miserable. If it was
an usher who, in spite of all their
efforts to exclude him, had fairly got
admittance into the schoolhouse, they
set up a sentry-box at his very door,
in which a rival usher held forth on
Cocker and the alphabet; they drew
off a few stray boys from the village
school, and this detachment, recruited
and reinforced by all the idlers of
the neighbourhood, to whom mischief
was sport, was studiously instructed
to keep up a perpetual whistling,
hooting, howling, hissing, and
imitations of the crowing of a cock, so
as to render it impossible for the usher
and boys within the school to hear or
profit by one word that was said. If
the scholars within were told to say
A, the blackguards without were bellowing
B; or if the usher asked how
many three times three made, the
answer from the outside would be
&quot;ten,&quot; or else that &quot;it depended upon
circumstances.&quot; Every week some
ribald and libellous paragraph would
appear in the county newspaper, headed
&quot;Advertisement,&quot; in such terms
as the following:&mdash;&quot;We have just
learned from the best authority, that
the usher of a school not a hundred
miles off from Hogs-Norton, has lately
been detected in various acts of forgery,
petty larceny, sedition, high
treason, burglary, &amp;c. &amp;c. If this
report be not officially contradicted
by the said usher within a fortnight,
by advertisement, duly inserted and
paid for in this newspaper, we shall
hold the same to be true.&quot; Or
sometimes more mysteriously thus:&mdash;&quot;Delicacy
forbids us to allude to
the shocking reports which are current
respecting the usher of Mullaglass.
Christian charity would lead
us to hope they were unfounded, but
Christian verity compels us to state
that we believe every word of them.&quot;
And though Jack and his editor sometimes
overshot their mark, and got
soused in damages at the instance of
those whom they had libelled, yet
Jack, who found that it answered his
ends, persevered, and so kept the
whole neighbourhood in hot water.</p>

<p>You would not believe me were I
to tell you of half the tyrannical and
preposterous pranks which he performed
about this period; but some of
them I can't help noticing. He had
picked up some subscriptions, for
instance, from charitable folks in the
neighbourhood, to build a school upon
a remote corner of North Farm, where
not a single boy had learned his alphabet
within the memory of man; and
what, think ye, does he do with the
money, but insists on clapping down
the new school exactly opposite the
<a class="pagenum" name="page363" id="page363" title="page363"></a>old school in the village, merely to
spite the poor usher, against whom he
had taken a dislike&mdash;though there was
no more need to build a school there
than to ship a cargo of coals for Newcastle.
Again, having ascertained
that one of his servants had been seen
shaking hands with some of Jack's
family with whom he had quarrelled
as above mentioned, he refused to give
him a character, though the poor fellow
was only thinking of taking service
somewhere in the plantations.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all Jack's efforts,
however, it sometimes happened that
when an usher was appointed he could
not get up a sufficient cabal against
him, and that even the schoolboys,
knowing something of the man before,
had no objection to him. In such
cases Jack resorted to various schemes
in order to cast the candidate upon his
examinations. Sometimes he would
shut him up in a small closet, telling him
he must answer a hundred and fifty
questions, in plane and spherical trigonometry,
within as many minutes, and
that he would be allowed the assistance
of Johnson's Dictionary, and the <i>Gradus
ad Parnassum</i>, for the purpose. At
other tines he would ask the candidate,
with a bland smile, what was his
opinion of things in general, and of
the dispute between him (Jack) and
the Squire in particular; and if that
question was not answered to his satisfaction,
he remitted him to his studies.
When no objection could be made to
the man's parts, Jack would say that
he had scruples of conscience, because
he doubted whether his commission
had been fairly come by, or whether
he had not bribed the Squire by a five-pound
note to obtain it. At last
he did not even take the trouble of
going through this farce, but would
at once, if he disliked the look of the
man's face, tell him he was busy at
the moment;&mdash;that he might lay the
Squire's letter on the table, and call
again that day six months for an answer.
He no longer pretended, in fact, to any
fairness or justice in his dealings;
for though those who sided with him
might be guilty of all the offences in
the calendar, Jack continued to wink
so hard, and shut his ears so close, as
not to see or hear of them; while as
to the unhappy wights who differed
from him, he had the eyes of Argus
and the ear of Dionysius, and the tender
mercies of a Spanish inquisitor,
discovering <i>scandalum magnatum</i> and
high treason in ballads which they had
written twenty years before, and in
which Jack, though he received a presentation
copy at the time, had never
pretended, up to that moment, to detect
the least harm.</p>

<p>The last of these freaks which I
shall here mention took place on this
wise. Jack had never been accustomed
to invite any one to his assemblies
but the ushers who had been appointed
by the Squire, and it was always
understood that they alone had a
vote in all vestry matters. But when
John quarrelled with his family, as above
mentioned, and a large part of the
oldest and most respectable of his relatives
drew off from him, it occurred
to Jack that he could bring in a set
of new auxiliaries, upon whose vote
he could count in all his family squabbles,
or his deputes, with Squire Bull;
and the following was the device he
fell upon for that end.</p>

<p>Here and there upon North Farm,
where the village schools were crowded,
little temporary schoolhouses had
been run up, where one or two of
the monitors were accustomed to
teach such of the children as could
not be accommodated in the larger
school. But these assistants had always
been a little looked down upon,
and had never been allowed a seat at
Jack's board. Now, however, he began
to change his tone towards them,
and to court and flatter them on all
occasions. One fine morning he suddenly
made his appearance on the village
green, followed by some of his
hangers on, bearing a theodolite,
chains, measuring rods, sextants, compasses,
and other instruments of land-surveying.
Jack set up his theodolite,
took his observations, began noting
measurements, and laying down the
bases of triangles in all directions, then,
having summed up his calculations
with much gravity, gave directions to
those about him to line off with stakes
and ropes the space which he pointed
out to them, and which in fact enclosed
nearly half the village. In the course
of these operations, the usher, who had
witnessed these mathematical proceedings
of Jack from the window, but could
not comprehend what the man would
be at, sallied forth, and accosting
Jack, asked him what he meant by
these strange lines of circumvallation.
&quot;Why,&quot; answered Jack, &quot;I have
<a class="pagenum" name="page364" id="page364" title="page364"></a>been thinking for some time past of
relieving you of part of your heavy
duties, and dividing the parish-school
between you and your assistant; so in
future you will confine yourself to the
space outside the ropes, and leave all
within the inclosure to him.&quot; It was
in vain that the usher protested he
was quite equal to the duty; that the
boys liked him, and disliked his assistant;
that if the village was thus
divided, the assistant would be put
upon a level with him, and have a
vote in the vestry, to which he had
no more right than to a seat in the
House of Commons. Jack was not
to be moved from his purpose, but
gave orders to have a similar apportionment
made in most of the neighbouring
villages, and then inviting the
assistants to a party at his house, he
had them sworn in as vestrymen,
telling them, that in future they
had the same right to a seat at his
board as the best of John's ushers
had. Here again, however, he found
he had run his head against a wall,
and that he was not the mighty personage
he took himself for; for, on a
complaint to the justices of the peace,
a dozen special constables were sent
down, who tore up the posts, removed
the ropes, and demolished all Jack's
inclosures in a trice.</p>

<p>These frequent defeats rendered
Jack nearly frantic. He now began
to quarrel even with his best friends,
not a few of whom, though they had
gone with him a certain length, now
left his house, and told him plainly
they would never set foot in it again.
He burst forth into loud invectives
against Martin, who had always been
a good friend to his penny subscriptions,
and more than once had come
to his assistance when Jack was hard
pressed by Hugh, a dissenting schoolmaster,
between whom and Jack
there had long been a bloody feud.
Jack now denounced Martin in set
terms; accused him of being in the
pay of Peter, with whom he said he had
been holding secret conferences of late
at the Cross-Keys; and of setting the
Squire's mind against him (Jack)&mdash;whereas
poor Martin, till provoked by
Jack's abuse to defend himself, had
never said an unkind word against
him. Finding, however, that, with
all his efforts, he did not make much
way with the men, Jack directed his
battery chiefly against the women,
who were easily caught by his sanctimonious
air, and knowing nothing
earthly of the subject, took for gospel
all that Jack chose to tell them.
He held love-feasts in his house up
to a late hour, at which he generally
harangued on the subject of the persecutions
which he endured. He vowed
the justices were all in a conspiracy
against him; that they were
constantly intruding into his grounds,
notwithstanding his warnings that
spring-guns were set in the premises;
that on one occasion a tall fellow of a
sheriff's officer had made his way into his
house and served him with a writ of <i>fieri
facias</i> even in the midst of one of his assemblies,
a disgrace he never could get
over; that he could not walk ten yards
in any direction, or saunter for an instant
at the corner of a street, without
being ordered by a policeman to move
on; in short, that he lived in perpetual
terror and anxiety&mdash;and all this because
he had done his best to save
them and their children from the awful
scourge of deboshed and despotical
ushers. At the conclusion of these
meetings he invariably handed round
his hat, into which the silly women dropped
a good many shillings, which Jack
assured them would be applied for the
public benefit, meaning thereby his
own private advantage.</p>

<p>Jack, however, with all his craze,
was too knowing not to see that the
women, beyond advancing him a few
shillings at a time, would do little
for his cause so far as any terms with
Squire Bull was concerned; so, with
the view of making a last attack upon
the Squire, and driving him into terms,
he began to look about for assistance
among those with whom he had previously
been at loggerheads. It cost him
some qualms before he could so far abase
his stomach as to do so; but at last he
ventured to address a long and pitiful
letter to Hugh, in which he set forth
all his disputes with John, and dwelt
much on his scruples of conscience;
begged him to forget old quarrels, and
put down his name to a Round Robin,
which he was about to address to the
Squire in his own behalf. To this
epistle Hugh answered as follows:&mdash;&quot;Dearly
beloved,&mdash;my bowels are
grieved for your condition, but I see
only one cure for your scruples of conscience.
Strip off the Squire's livery,
and give up your place, as I did, and
your peace of mind will be restored
<a class="pagenum" name="page365" id="page365" title="page365"></a>to you. In the mean time, I do not
see very well why I should help you
to pocket the Squire's wages, and do
nothing for it. Yours, in the spirit
of meekness and forgiveness&mdash;HUGH.&quot;
After this rebuff, Jack, you may easily
believe, saw there was little hope of
assistance from that quarter.</p>

<p>As a last resource, he called a
general meeting of his friends, at which
it was resolved to present the proposed
Round Robin to John, signed
by as many names as they could muster;
in which Jack, who seemed to be
of opinion that the more they asked
the greater was their chance of getting
something at least, set forth the articles
he wanted, and without which,
he told John, he could no longer remain
in his house; but that he and
his relatives and friends would forthwith,
if this petition was rejected,
walk out, to the infinite scandal of the
neighbourhood, leaving the Squire
without a teacher or a writing-master
within fifty miles to supply their place.
They demanded that the Squire should
give up the nomination of the ushers
entirely, though in whose favour they
did not explain; and that Jack was in
future to be a law unto himself, and
to be supreme in all matters of education,
with power to himself to define
in what such matters consisted. On
these requests being conceded, they
stated that they would continue to
give their countenance to the Squire
as in times past; otherwise the whole
party must quit possession incontinently.
Jack prevailed on a good
many to sign this document&mdash;though
some did not like the idea of walking
out, demurred, and added after the
word <i>incontinently</i>, &quot;<i>i.e.</i> when
convenient,&quot;&mdash;and thus signed, they put the
Round Robin under a twopenny
cover, and dispatched it to &quot;John
Bull, Esquire&quot;&mdash;with haste.</p>

<p>If they really thought the Squire
was to be bullied into these terms by
this last sally, they found themselves
consumedly mistaken; for after a time
down came a long and perfectly civil
letter from the Squire's secretary, telling
them their demands were totally
out of the question, and that the
Squire would see them at the antipodes
sooner than comply with them.</p>

<p>Did Jack then, you will ask, walk
out as he had threatened, when he got
the Squire's answer? Not he. He
now gave notice that he intended to
apply for an Act of Parliament on the
subject: and that, in the meantime,
the matter might stand over. Meantime,
and in case matters should come
to the worst, he is busily engaged
begging all over the country, for cash
to erect a new wooden tenement for
him, in the event of his having to leave
his old one of stone and lime. Some
say even that he has been seen laying
down several pounds of gunpowder
in the cellar of his present house, and
has been heard to boast of his intention
to blow up his successor when
he takes possession; but for my
own part, and seeing how he has
shuffled hitherto, I believe that he is
no nearer removing than he was a
year ago. Indeed he has said confidentially
to several people, that even
if his new house were all ready for
him, he could not, with his asthmatic
tendency, think of entering it for a
twelvemonth or so, till the lath and
plaster should be properly seasoned.
Of all this, however, we shall hear
more anon.</p>

<h2>PAUL DE KOCKNEYISMS.</h2>

<h3>BY A COCKNEY.</h3>

<p>When any one thinks of French
literature, there immediately rises before
him a horrid phantasmagoria of
repulsive objects&mdash;murders, incests,
parricides, and every imaginable shape
of crime that horror e'er conceived or
fancy feigned. He sees the whole
efforts of a press, brimful of power
and talent, directed against every
thing that has hitherto been thought
necessary to the safety of society,
or the happiness of domestic life&mdash;marriage
deliberately written down,
and proved to be the cause of all the
miseries of the social state: and strange
to say, in the crusade against matrimony,
the sharpest swords and strongest
lances are wielded by women.
Those women are received into society&mdash;men's
wives and daughters associate
with them&mdash;and their books are
noticed in the public journals without
any allusions to the Association for the
prevention of vice, but rather with the
praises which, in other times and
countries, would have been bestowed
on works of genius and virtue. The
taste of the English public has certainly
deteriorated within the last few
years; and popularity, the surest index
of the public's likings, though not
of the writer's deservings, has attended
works of which the great staple
has been crime and blackguardism. A
certain rude power, a sort of unhealthy
energy, has enabled the writer
to throw an interest round pickpockets
and murderers; and if this interest
were legitimately produced, by the
exhibition of human passions modified
by the circumstances of the actor&mdash;if
it arose from the development of one
real, living, thinking, doing, and suffering
man's heart, we could only wonder
at the author's choice of such a
subject, but we should be ready to acknowledge
that he had widened our
sphere of knowledge&mdash;and made us
feel, as we all do, without taking the
same credit for it to ourselves that
the old blockhead in France does, that
being human, we have sympathies with
all, even the lowest and wickedest of
our kind. But the interest those works
excite arises from no such legitimate
source&mdash;not from the development of
our common nature, but from the creation
of a new one&mdash;from startling
contrasts, not of two characters but of
one&mdash;tenderness, generosity in one
page; fierceness and murder in the
next. But though our English <i>tastes</i>
are so far deteriorated as to tolerate,
or even to admire, the records
of cruelty and sin now proceeding
every day from the press&mdash;our English
<i>morals</i> would recoil with horror
from the deliberate wickedness
which forms the great attraction of
the French modern school of romance.
The very subjects chosen for their
novels, by the most popular of their
female writers, shows a state of feeling
in the authors more dreadful to
contemplate than the mere coarse raw-head-and-bloody-bones
descriptions of
our chroniclers of Newgate. A married
woman, the heroine&mdash;high in
rank, splendid in intellect, radiant
in beauty&mdash;has for the hero a villain
escaped from the hulks. There is no
record of his crimes&mdash;we are not called
upon to follow him in his depredations,
or see him cut throats in the
scientific fashion of some of our indigenous
rascals. He is the philosopher,&mdash;the
instructor&mdash;the guide. The object
of <i>his</i> introduction is to show the
iniquity of human laws&mdash;the object
of <i>her</i> introduction is to show the absurdity
of the institution of marriage.
This would never be tolerated in England.
Again, a married woman is
presented to us&mdash;for the sympathy
which with us attends a young couple
to the church-door, only begins in
France after they have left it: as a
child she has been betrothed to a person
of her own rank&mdash;at five or six incurable
idiocy takes possession of her
proposed husband&mdash;but when she is
eighteen the marriage takes place&mdash;the
husband is a mere child still; for
his intellect has continued stationary
though his body has reached maturity&mdash;a
more revolting picture was never
presented than that of the condition of
the idiot's wife&mdash;her horror of her husband&mdash;and
of course her passion for
another. The most interesting scenes
between the lovers are constantly interrupted
by the hideous representative of
<a class="pagenum" name="page367" id="page367" title="page367"></a>matrimony, the grinning husband, who
rears his slavering countenance from
behind the sofa, and impresses his unfortunate
wife with a sacred awe for
the holy obligations of marriage.</p>

<p>Again, a dandy of fifty is presented
to us, whose affection for his ward has
waited, of course, till she is wedded to
another, to ripen into love. He still
continues her protector against the
advances of others; for jealousy is a
good point of character in every one
but the husband, and there it is only
ridiculous. The husband in this case
is another admirable specimen of the
results of wedlock for life&mdash;he is a
chattering, shallow pretender&mdash;a political
economist, prodigiously dull
and infinitely conceited&mdash;an exaggerated
type of the Hume-Bowring statesman&mdash;and,
as is naturally to be expected,
our sympathies are awakened
for the wretched wife, and we rejoice
to see that her beauty and talents, her
fine mind and pure ideas, are appreciated
by a dashing young fellow, who
outwits our original friend the dandy
of fifty and the philosophical deput&eacute;;
the whole leaving a pleasing impression
on the reader's mind from the conviction
that the heroine is no longer neglected.</p>

<p>From the similarity of these stories&mdash;and
they are only taken at random
from a great number&mdash;it will be seen
that the spirit of almost all of them is
the same. But when we go lower in
the scale, and leave the class of philosophic
novels, we find their tales of
life and manners still more absurd
in their total untrueness than the
others were hateful in their design.
There is a novel just now appearing
in one of the most widely-circulated
of the Parisian papers, so grotesquely
overdone, that if it had been meant
for a caricature of the worst parts of
our own hulk-and-gallows authors, it
would have been very much admired;
but meant to be serious, powerful,
harrowing, and all the rest of it, it is
a most curious exhibition of a nation's
taste and a writer's audacity. The
<i>Mysteries of Paris</i>, by Eugene Sue,
has been dragging its slow length
along for a long time, and gives no
sign of getting nearer its denouement
than when it began. A sovereign
prince is the hero&mdash;his own daughter,
whom he has disowned, the heroine;
and the tale commences by his fighting
a man on the street, and taking a
fancy to his unknown child, who is
the inhabitant of one of the lowest
dens in the St Giles' of Paris! The
other <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> are convicts,
receivers of stolen goods, murderers,
intriguers of all ranks&mdash;the
aforesaid prince, sometimes in the disguise
of a workman, sometimes of a
pickpocket, acting the part of a providence
among them, rewarding the
good and punishing the guilty. The
English personages are the Countess
Sarah McGregor&mdash;the lawful wife of
the prince&mdash;her brother Tom, and Sir
Walter Murph, Esquire. These are all
jostled, and crowded, and pushed, and
flurried&mdash;first in flash kens, where the
language is slang; then in country
farms, and then in halls and palaces&mdash;and
so intermixed and confused, that
the clearest head gets puzzled with
the entanglements of the story; and
confusion gets worse confounded as
the farrago proceeds. How M. Sue
will manage ever to come to a close is
an enigma to us; and we shall wait
with some impatience to see how he
will distribute his poetic justice, when
he can't get his puppets to move another
step. Horror seems the great
ingredient in the present literary fare
of France, and in the <i>Myst&egrave;res de
Paris</i> the most confirmed glutton of
such delicacies may sup full of them.
In the midst of such depraved and
revolting exhibitions, it is a sort of
satisfaction, though not of the loftiest
kind, to turn to the coarse fun and
ludicrous descriptions of Paul de Kock.
And, after all, our friend Paul has not
many more sins than coarseness and
buffoonery to answer for. As to his
attempting, of set purpose, to corrupt
people's morals, it never entered into
his head. He does not know what
morals are; they never form any part
of his idea of manners or character.
If a good man comes in his way, he
looks at him with a strange kind of
unacquaintance that almost rises into
respect; but he is certainly more affectionate,
and on far better terms,
with men about town&mdash;amative hairdressers,
flirting grisettes, and the
whole genus, male and female, of the
epiciers. It would no doubt be an
improvement if the facetious Paul
could believe in the existence of an
honest woman; but such women as
come in his way he describes to the
life. A ball in a dancing-master's
private room up six pairs of stairs, a
pic-nic to one of the suburbs, a dinner
at a restaurateur's, or a family consultation
<a class="pagenum" name="page368" id="page368" title="page368"></a>on a proposal of marriage,
are far more in Paul's way than tales
of open horror or silk-and-satin depravity.
One is only sorry, in the midst
of so much gaiety and good-humour,
to stumble on some scene or sentiment
that gives on the inclination to
throw the book in the fire, or start,
like C&aelig;sar, on the top of the diligence
to pull the author's ears. But the
next page sets all right again; and
you go on laughing at the disasters of
my neighbour Raymond, or admiring
the graces or Chesterfieldian politeness
of M. Bellequeue. French nature
seems essentially different from
all the other natures hitherto known;
and yet, though so new, there never
rises any doubt that it is <i>a</i> nature, a
reality, as Thomas Carlyle says, and
not a sham. The personages presented
to us by Paul de Kock can scarcely,
in the strict sense of the word, be
called human beings; but they are
French beings of real flesh and blood,
speaking and thinking French in the
most decided possible manner, and at
intervals possessed of feelings which
make us inclined to include them in
the great genus <i>homo</i>, though with
so many inseparable accidents, that it
is impossible for a moment to shut
one's eyes to the species to which
they belong. But such as they are in
their shops, and back-parlours, and
ball-rooms, and <i>f&ecirc;tes champ&ecirc;tres</i>, there
they are in Paul de Kock&mdash;nothing
extenuated, little set down in malice&mdash;vain,
empty, frivolous, good-tempered,
gallant, lively, and absurd. Let us
go to the wood of Romainville to celebrate
the anniversary of the marriage
of M. and Madame Moutonnet on the
day of St Eustache.</p>

<p>&quot;At a little distance from the ball,
towards the middle of the wood, a numerous
party is seated on the grass, or
rather on the sand; napkins are spread
on the ground, and covered with plates
and cold meat and fruits. The bottles
are placed in the cool shade, the glasses
are filled and emptied rapidly; good appetites
and open air make every thing
appear excellent. They make plates
out of paper, and toss pieces of pat&eacute;
and sausage to each other. They eat,
they drink, they sing, they laugh and
play tricks. It seems a struggle who
shall be funniest. It is well known
that all things are allowable in the
country; and the cits now assembled
in the wood of Romainville seem fully
persuaded of the fact. A jolly old
governor of about fifty tries to carve
a turkey, and can't succeed. A little
woman, very red, very fat, and very
round, hastens to seize a limb of the
bird; she pulls at one side, the jolly
old governor at the other&mdash;the leg separates
at last, and the lady goes
sprawling on the grass, while the
gentleman topples over in the opposite
direction with the remainder of the
animal in his hand. The shouts of
laughter redouble, and M. Moutonnet&mdash;such
is the name of the jolly old
governor&mdash;resumes his place, declaring
that he will never try to carve
any thing again. 'I knew you would
never be able to manage it,' said a
large woman bluntly, in a tone that
agreed exactly with her starched and
crabbed features. She was sitting
opposite the stout gentleman, and had
seen with indignation the alacrity with
which the little lady had flown to M.
Moutonnet's assistance.</p>

<p>&quot;'In the twenty years we have been
married,' she continued, 'have you
ever carved any thing at home, sir?'</p>

<p>&quot;'No, my dear, that's very true;'
replied the stout gentleman in a submissive
voice, and trying to smile his
better half into good-humour.</p>

<p>&quot;'You don't know how to help a
dish of spinach, and yet you attempt
a dish like that!'</p>

<p>&quot;'My dear&mdash;in the country, you
know&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>&quot;'In the country, sir, as in the town,
people shouldn't try things they can't
perform.'</p>

<p>&quot;'You know, Madame Moutonnet,
that generally I never attempt any
thing&mdash;but to day'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;'To day you should have done
as you do on other days,' retorted the
lady.</p>

<p>&quot;'Ah, but, my love, you forget that
this is Saint Eustache&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>&quot;'Yes, yes, this is Saint Eustache!'
is repeated in chorus by the whole
company, and the glasses are filled
and jingled as before.</p>

<p>&quot;'To the health of Eustache; Eustache
for ever!'</p>

<p>&quot;'To yours, ladies and gentlemen,'
replied M. Moutonnet graciously smiling&mdash;'and
yours, my angel.'</p>

<p>&quot;It is to his wife M. Moutonnet addresses
himself. She tried to assume
an amiable look, and condescends to
approach her glass to that of M. Eustache
Moutonnet. M. Eustache Moutonnet
is a rich laceman of the Rue
St Martin; a man highly respected
<a class="pagenum" name="page369" id="page369" title="page369"></a>in trade; no bill of his was ever protested,
nor any engagement failed in.
For the thirty years he has kept shop
he has been steadily at work from
eight in the morning till eight at night.
His department is to take care of the
day-book and ledger; Madame Moutonnet
manages the correspondence
and makes the bargains. The business
of the shop and the accounts are
confided to an old clerk and Mademoiselle
Eugenie Moutonnet, with
whom we shall presently become better
acquainted.</p>

<p>&quot;M. Moutonnet, as you may perhaps
already have perceived, is not
commander-in-chief at hone. His
wife directs, rules, and governs all
things. When she is in good-humour&mdash;a
somewhat extraordinary occurrence&mdash;she
allows her husband to go
and take his little cup of coffee, provided
he goes for that purpose to
the coffee-house at the corner of
the Rue Mauconseil&mdash;for it is famous
for its liberal allowance of sugar, and
M. Moutonnet always brings home
three lumps of it to his wife. On
Sundays they dine a little earlier, to
have time for a promenade to the
Tuileries or the Jardin Turk. Excursions
into the country are very
rare, and only on extraordinary occasions,
such as the f&ecirc;te-day of M. and
Madame Moutonnet. That regular
life does not hinder the stout lace-merchant
from being the happiest of
men&mdash;so true is it that what is one
man's poison is another man's meat.
M. Moutonnet was born with simple
tastes&mdash;she required to be led and
managed like a child. Don't shrug
your shoulders at this avowal, ye
spirited gentlemen, so proud of your
rights, so puffed up with your merits.
You! who think yourselves always
masters of your actions, you yield to
your passions every day! they lead
you, and sometimes lead you very ill.
Well, M. Moutonnet has no fear of
that&mdash;he has no passions&mdash;he knows
nothing but his trade, and obedience
to his spouse. He finds that a man
can be very happy, though he does
not know how to carve a turkey, and
lets himself be governed by his wife.
Madame Moutonnet is long past forty,
but it is a settled affair that she is
never to be more than thirty-six. She
never was handsome, but she is large
and tall, and her husband is persuaded
she is superb. She is not a coquette,
but she thinks herself superior
to every body else in talents and beauty.
She never cared a rush about her husband,
but if he was untrue to her she
would tear his eyes out. Madame
Moutonnet, you perceive, is excessively
jealous of her rights. A daughter is
the sole issue of the marriage of M.
Eustache Moutonnet and Mademoiselle
Barbe Desormeaux. She is now
eighteen years old, and at eighteen
the young ladies in Paris are generally
pretty far advanced. But Eugenie
has been educated severely&mdash;and although
possessed of a good deal of
spirit, is timid, docile, submissive,
and never ventures on a single observation
in presence of her parents.
She has cleverness, grace, and sensibility,
but she is ignorant of the advantages
she has received from nature&mdash;her
sentiments are as yet concentrated
at the bottom of her heart.
She is not coquettish&mdash;or rather she
scarcely ventures to give way to the
inclination so natural to women, which
leads them to please and to be pretty.
But Eugenie has no need of those
little arts, so indispensable to others,
or to have recourse to her mirror every
hour. She is well made, and she is
beautiful; her eyes are soft and expressive,
her voice is tender and agreeable,
her brow is shadowed by dark
locks of hair, her mouth furnished with
fine white teeth. In short, she has
that nameless something about her,
which charms at first sight, which is
not always possessed by greater beauties
and more regular features. We
now know all the Moutonnet family;
and since we have gone so far, let us
make acquaintance with the rest of
the party who have come to the wood
of Romainville to celebrate the Saint
Eustache.</p>

<p>&quot;The little woman who rushed so
vigorously to the assistance of M.
Moutonnet, is the wife of a tall gentleman
of the name of Bernard, who
is a toyman in the Rue St Denis. M.
Bernard plays the amiable and the
fool at the same time. He laughs and
quizzes, makes jokes, and even puns;
he is the wit of the party. His wife has
been rather good-looking, and wishes
to be so still. She squeezes in her
waist till she can hardly breathe, and
takes an hour to fit her shoes on&mdash;for
she is determined to have a small foot.
Her face is a little too red; but her
eyes are very lively, and she is constantly
<a class="pagenum" name="page370" id="page370" title="page370"></a>trying to give them as mischievous
an expression as she can.
Madame Bernard has a great girl of
fifteen, whom she dresses as if she
were five, and treats occasionally to
a new doll, by way of keeping her a
child. By the side of Madame Bernard
is seated a young man of eighteen,
who is almost as timid as Eugenie,
and blushes when he is spoken
to, though he has stood behind a counter
for six months. He is the son of
a friend of M. Bernard, and his wife
has undertaken to patronize him, and
introduce him to good society.</p>

<p>&quot;A person of about forty years of
age, with one of those silly countenances
which there is no mistaking at
the first glance, is seated beside Eugenie.
M. Dupont&mdash;such is his name&mdash;is
a rich grocer of the Rue aux
Ours. He wears powder and a queue,
because he fancies they are becoming,
and his hairdresser has told him
that they are very aristocratic. His
coat of sky-blue, and his jonquil-coloured
waistcoat, give him still more
the appearance of a simpleton, and
agree admirably with the astonished
expression of his gooseberry eyes. He
dangles two watch-chains, that hang
down his nankeen trowsers, with great
satisfaction, and seems struck with admiration
at the wisdom of his own
remarks. He thinks himself captivating
and full of wit. He has the
presumption of ignorance, propped up
by money. Finally, he is a bachelor,
which gives him great consideration
in all the families where there are
marriageable daughters. M. and
Madame Gerard, perfumers in the
Rue St Martin, are also of the party.
The perfumer enacts the gallant gay
Lothario, and in his own district has
the reputation of a prodigious rake,
though he is ugly, and ill-made, and
squints. But he fancies he overcomes
all these drawbacks by covering himself
with odours and perfumes&mdash;accordingly,
you smell him half an hour
before he comes in sight. His wife
is young and pretty. She married
him at fifteen, and has a boy of nine,
who looks more like her brother than
her son. The little Gerard hollos
and jumps about, breaks the glasses
and bottles, and makes as much noise
as all the rest of the company put together.
'He's a little lion,' exclaims
M. Gerard; 'he's exactly what I
was. You never could hear yourselves
speak wherever I was, at his age.
People were delighted with me. My
son is my perfect image.'</p>

<p>&quot;M. Gerard's sister, an old maid of
forty-five, who takes every opportunity
of declaring that she never intends
to marry, and sighs every tine
M. Dupont looks at her, is next to
M. Moutonnet. The old clerk of the
laceman&mdash;M. Bidois&mdash;who waits for
Madame Moutonnet's permission before
he opens his mouth, and fills his
glass every time she is not looking&mdash;is
placed at the side of Mademoiselle
Cecile Gerard; who, though she swears
every minute that she never will
marry, and that she hates the men,
is very ill pleased to have old M.
Bidois for her neighbour, and hints
pretty audibly that Madame Bernard
monopolizes all the young beaux. A
young man of about twenty, tall,
well-made, with handsome features,
whose intelligent expression announces
that he is intended for higher
things than perpetually to be measuring
yards of calico, is seated at the
right hand of Eugenie. That young
man, whose name is Adolphe, is assistant
in a fashionable warehouse
where Madame Moutonnet deals; and
as he always gives good measure, she
has asked him to the f&ecirc;te of St Eustache.
And now we are acquainted
with all the party who are celebrating
the marriage-day of M. Moutonnet.&quot;</p>

<p>We are not going to follow Paul de
Kock in the adventures of all the party
so carefully described to us. Our
object in translating the foregoing
passage, was to enable our readers to
see the manner of people who indulge
in pic-nics in the wood of Romainville,
desiring them to compare M.
Moutonnet and <i>his</i> friends, with any
laceman and <i>his</i> friends he may choose
to fix upon in London. A laceman
as well to do in the world as M. Moutonnet,
a grocer as rich as M. Dupont,
and even a perfumer as fashionable
as M. Gerard, would have a whitebait
dinner at Blackwall, or make up
a party to the races at Epsom&mdash;and
as to admitting such a humble servitor
as M. Bidois to their society, or even
the unfriended young mercer's assistant,
M. Adolphe, they would as soon
think of inviting one of the new police.
Five miles from town our three friends
would pass themselves off for lords,
and blow-up the waiter for not making
haste with their brandy and water, in
<a class="pagenum" name="page371" id="page371" title="page371"></a>the most aristocratic manner imaginable.
In France, or at least in Paul
de Kock, there seems no straining after
appearances. The laceman continues
a laceman when he is miles
away from the little back shop; and
even the laceman's lady has no desire
to be mistaken for the wife of a squire.
Madame Moutonnet seems totally unconscious
of the existence of any lady
whatever, superior to herself in rank
or station. The Red Book is to her
a sealed volume. Her envies, hatreds,
friendships, rivalries, and ambitions,
are all limited to her own circle. The
wife of a rich laceman, on the other
hand, in England, most religiously
despises the wives of almost all other
tradesmen; she scarcely knows in
what street the shop is situated, but
from the altitudes of Balham or Hampstead,
looks down with supreme disdain
on the toiling creatures who
stand all day behind a counter. The
husband, in the same way, manages
to cast off every reminiscence of the
shop, in the course of his three miles
in the omnibus, and at six or seven
o'clock you might fancy they were a
duke and duchess, sitting in a gaudily
furnished drawing-room, listening to
two elegant young ladies torturing a
piano, and another still more elegant
young lady severely flogging a harp.
The effect of this, so far as our English
Paul de Kocks are concerned, is,
that their linen-drapers, and lacemen,
and rich perfumers, are represented
assuming a character that does not
belong to them, and aping people
whom they falsely suppose to be their
betters; whereas the genuine Paul
paints the Parisian tradesmen without
any affectation at all. Ours are made
laughable by the common farcical attributes
of all pretensions, great or
small; while real unsophisticated
shopkeeping (French) nature is the
staple of Paul's character-sketches,
and they are more valuable, and in
the end more interesting, accordingly.
Who cares for the exaggerated efforts
of a Manchester warehouseman to be
polished and gentlemanly? It is only
acting after all, and gives us no insight
into his real character, or the character
of his class, any more than Mr
Coates' anxiety to be Romeo enlightened
us as to his disposition in other
respects. The Manchester warehouseman,
though he fails in his attempt
at fashionable parts, may be a very estimable
and pains-taking individual,
and, with the single exception of that
foible, offers nothing to the most careful
observer to distinguish him from
the stupid and respectable in any part
of the world. And in this respect,
any one starting as the chronicler of
citizen life among us, would labour
under a great disadvantage. Whether
our people are phlegmatic, or stupid,
or sensible&mdash;all three of which epithets
are generally applicable to the same
individual&mdash;or that they have no opportunities
of showing their peculiarities
from the domestic habits of the
animal&mdash;it is certain that, however
better they may be qualified for the
business of life than their neighbours,
they are far less fitted for the pages
of a book. And the proof of it is this,
that wherever any of our novelists has
introduced a tradesman, he has either
been an invention altogether, or a caricature.
Even Bailie Nicol Jarvie
never lived in the Saut Market in
half such true flesh and blood as he
does in <i>Rob Roy</i>. At all events, the
inimitable Bailie is known to the universe
at large by the additions made
to his real character by the prodigal
hand of his biographer, and the ridiculous
contrasts in which he is placed
with the caterans and reivers of the
hills. In the city of Glasgow he was
looked upon, and justly, as an honour
to the gude town&mdash;consulted on all
difficult matters, and famous for his
knowledge of the world and his natural
sagacity. Would this have been
a fit subject for description? or is it
just to think of the respectable Bailie
in the ridiculous point of view in
which he is presented to us in the
Highlands? How would Sir Peter
Laurie look if he had been taken long
ago by Algerine pirates, and torn,
with all his civic honours thick upon
him, from the magisterial chair, and
made hairdresser to the ladies of the
harem&mdash;threatened with the bastinado
for awkwardness in combing, as
he now commits other unfortunate
fellows to the treadmill for crimes
scarcely more enormous? Paul de
Kock derives none of his interest
from odd juxtapositions. He knows
nothing about caves and prisons and
brigands&mdash;but he knows every corner
of coffee-houses, and beer-shops, and
ball-rooms. And these ball-rooms
give him the command of another set
of characters, totally unknown to the
English world of fiction, because non-existent
in England. With us, no
<a class="pagenum" name="page372" id="page372" title="page372"></a>shop-boy or apprentice would take
his sweetheart to a public hop at any
of the licenced music-houses. No
decent girl would go there, nor even
any girl that wished to keep up the
appearance of decency. No flirtations,
to end in matrimony, take their
rise between an embryo boot-maker
and a barber's daughter, in the course
of the <i>chaine Anglaise</i> beneath the
trees of the Green Park, or even at
the Yorkshire Stingo. Fathers have
flinty hearts, and the above-mentioned
barber would probably increase
the beauty of his daughter's &quot;bonny
black eye,&quot; by giving her another, if
she talked of going to a ball, whether
in a room or the open air. The Puritans
have left their mark. Dancing
is always sinful, and Satan is perpetual
M.C. But let us follow the barber,
or rather hairdresser&mdash;for the
mere gleaner of beards is not intended
by the name&mdash;into his own amusements.
In Paul de Kock he goes to a
coffee-house, drinks a small cup of coffee,
and pockets the entire sugar; or
to a ball, where he performs all the offices
of a court chamberlain, and captivates
all hearts by his graceful deportment.
His wife, perhaps, goes
with him, and flirts in a very business-like
manner with a tobacconist;
and his daughter is whirled about in
a waltz by Eugene or Adolphe, the
young confectioner, with as much
elegance and decorum as if they were
a young marquis and his bride in the
dancing hall at Devonshire House.
Our English friend goes to enjoy a
pipe, or, if he has lofty notions, a
cigar, and gin and water, at the neighbouring
inn. Or when he determines
on having a night of real rational enjoyment,
he goes to some tavern
where singing is the order of the
evening. A stout man in the chair
knocks on the table, and being the
landlord, makes disinterested enquiries
if every gentleman has a bumper.
He then calls on himself for a song,
and states that he is to be accompanied
on the piano by a distinguished
performer; whereupon, a tall young
man of a moribund expression of
countenance, and with his hair closely
pomatumed over his head, rises, and,
after a low bow, seats himself at the
instrument. The stout man sings,
the young man plays, and thunders
of applause, and various fresh orders
for kidneys and strong ale, and welch
rabbits and cold-without, reward
their exertions. Drinking goes on
for some time, and waiters keep flying
about with dishes of all kinds, and the
hairdresser becomes communicative
to his next neighbour, a butcher from
Whitechapel, and they exchange their
sentiments about kidneys and music
in general, and the kidneys and music
now offered to them in particular. In
a few minutes, a gentleman with a
strange obliquity in his vision, seated
in the middle of the coffee-room, takes
off his hat, and after a thump on the
table from the landlord's hammer,
commences a song so intensely comic,
that when it is over, the orders for
supper and drink are almost unanimous.
The house is now full, the
theatres have discharged their hungry
audiences, and a distinguished
guinea-a-week performer seats himself
in the very next box to the hairdresser.
That worthy gentleman by
this time is stuffed so full of kidneys,
and has drank so many glasses of
brandy and water, that he can scarcely
understand the explanations of the
Whitechapel butcher, who has a great
turn for theatricals, and wishes to treat
the dramatic performer to a tumbler
of gin-twist. Another knock on the
table produces a momentary silence,
and a little man starts off with an extempore
song, where the conviviality
of the landlord, and the goodness of
his suppers, are duly chronicled. The
hairdresser hears a confused buzz of
admiration, and even attempts to join
in it, but thinks it, at last, time to go.
He goes, and narrowly escapes making
the acquaintance of Mr Jardine,
from his extraordinary propensity to
brush all the lamp-posts he encounters
with the shoulder of his coat; and gets
home, to the great comfort of his wife
and daughter, who have gone cozily
off to sleep, in the assurance that their
distinguished relative is safely locked
up in the police-office. The Frenchman,
on the other hand, never gets
into mischief from an overdose of <i>eau
sucr&eacute;e</i>, though sometimes he certainly
becomes very rombustious from a glass
or two of <i>vin ordinaire</i>; and nothing
astonishes us so much as the small
quantities of small drink which have
an effect on the brains of the steadiest
of the French population. They get
not altogether drunk, but decidedly
very talkative, and often quarrelsome,
on a miserable modicum of their indigenous
small beer, to a degree which
would not be excusable if it were
<a class="pagenum" name="page373" id="page373" title="page373"></a>brandy. We constantly find whole
parties at a pic-nic in a most prodigious
state of excitement after two
rounds of a bottle&mdash;jostling the peasants,
and talking more egregious
nonsense than before. And when they
quarrel, what a Babel of words, and
what a quakerism of hands! Instead
of a round or two between the parties,
as it would be in our own pugnacious
disagreements, they merely, when it
comes to the worst, push each other
from side to side, and shout lustily for
the police; and squalling women, and
chattering men, and ignorant country
people, and elegant mercers' apprentices,
and gay-mannered grocers, hustle,
and scream, and swear, and lecture,
and threaten, and bluster&mdash;but not a
single blow! The guardian of the
public peace appears, and the combatants
evanish into thin air; and in a
few minutes after this dreadful <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>,
the violin strikes up a fresh waltz, and
all goes &quot;gaily as a marriage-bell.&quot; We
don't say, at the present moment, that
one of these methods of conducting a
quarrel is better than the other, (though
we confess we are rather partial to a
hit in the bread-basket, or a tap on the
claret-cork)&mdash;all we mean to advance
is, that with the materials to work
upon, Paul de Kock, as a faithful
describer of real scenes, has a manifest
advantage over the describer of English
incidents of a parallel kind.</p>

<p>The affectations of a French cit,
when that nondescript animal condescends
to be affected, are more varied
and interesting than those of their
brethren here. He has a taste for the
fine arts&mdash;he talks about the opera&mdash;likes
to know artists and authors&mdash;and,
though living up five or six pairs of
stairs in a narrow lane, gives <i>soir&eacute;es</i>
and <i>conversazion&eacute;s</i>. More ludicrous all
this, and decidedly less disgusting,
than the assumptions of our man-milliners
and fishmongers. There is
short sketch by Paul de Kock, called
a <i>Soir&eacute;e Bourgeoise</i>, which we translate
entire, as an illustration of this
curious phase of French character;
and we shall take an early opportunity
of bringing before our readers
the essays of the daily feuilletonists of
the Parisian press, which give a clearer
insight into the peculiarities of French
domestic literature than can be acquired
in any other quarter.</p>

<h3>A CIT'S SOIREE.</h3>

<p>Lights were observed some time
ago, in the four windows of an apartment
on the second floor of a house in
the Rue Grenetat. It was not quite
so brilliant as the Cercle des Etrangers,
but still it announced something.
These four windows, with lights glancing
in them all, had an air of rejoicing,
and the industrious inhabitants of
the Rue Grenetat, who don't generally
go to much expense for illumination,
even in their shops, looked at the four
windows which eclipsed the street
lamps in their brilliancy, and said,
&quot;There's certainly something very
extraordinary going on this evening
at M. Lupot's!&quot; M. Lupot is an
honest tradesman, who has retired
from business some time. After having
sold stationary for thirty years,
without ever borrowing of a neighbour,
or failing in a payment, M.
Lupot, having scraped together an
income of three hundred and twenty
pounds, disposed of his stock in trade,
and closed his ledger, to devote himself
entirely to the pleasures of domestic
life with his excellent spouse,
Madam Felicit&eacute; Lupot&mdash;a woman of
an amazingly apathetic turn of mind,
who did admirably well in the shop
as long as she had only to give change
for half-crowns, but whose abilities
extended no further. But this had not
prevented her from making a very
good wife to her husband, (which
proves that much talent is not required
for that purpose,) and presenting
him with a daughter and a son.</p>

<p>The daughter was the eldest, and
had attained her seventeenth year;
and M. Lupot, who spared nothing
on her education, did not despair of
finding a husband for her with a soul
above sticks of sealing-wax and wafers&mdash;more
especially as it was evident
she had no turn for trade, and believed
she had a decided genius for the
fine arts&mdash;for she had painted her father
as a shepherd with his crook,
when she was only twelve, and had
learned a year after to play &quot;Je suis
Lindore&quot; by ear on the piano. M.
Lupot was proud of his daughter,
who was thus a painter and a musician;
who was a foot taller than her
papa; who held herself as upright as
a Prussian grenadier; who made a
<a class="pagenum" name="page374" id="page374" title="page374"></a>curtsy like Taglioni, who had a Roman
nose three times the size of
other people's, a mouth to match, and
eyes so arch and playful, that it was
difficult to discover them. The boy
was only seven; he was allowed to do
whatever he chose&mdash;he was so very
young; and Monsieur Ascanius
availed himself of the permission, and
was in mischief from morning to
night. His father was too fond of
him to scold him, and his mother
wouldn't take the trouble to get into
a passion.</p>

<p>Well, then, one morning M. Lupot
soliloquized&mdash;&quot;I have a good fortune,
a charming family, and a wife who has
never been in a rage; but all this does
not lead to a man's being invited,
courted, and made much of in the
world. Since I have cut the hotpress-wove
and red sealing-wax, I have seen
nobody but a few friends&mdash;retired
tradesmen like myself&mdash;who drop in
to take a hand at <i>vingt-et-un</i>, or loto;
but I wish more than that&mdash;my daughter
must not live in so narrow a circle;
my daughter has a decided turn for the
arts; I ought to have artists to my
house. I will give soir&eacute;es, tea-parties&mdash;yes,
with punch at parting, if it be
necessary. We shall play <i>bouillote</i>
and <i>&eacute;carte</i>, for my daughter can't endure
loto. Indeed, I wish to set people
talking about my re-unions, and to
find a husband for Celanire worthy of
her.&quot; M. Lupot was seated near his
wife, who was seated on an elastic
sofa, and was caressing a cat on her
knee. He said to her&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;My dear Felicit&eacute;, I intend to give
soir&eacute;es&mdash;to receive lots of company.
We live in too confined a sphere for
our daughter, who was born for the
arts&mdash;and for Ascanius, who, it strikes
me, will make some noise in the
world.&quot;</p>

<p>Madame Lupot continued to caress
the cat, and replied, &quot;Well, what have
I to do with that? Do I hinder you
from receiving company? If it doesn't
cause me any trouble&mdash;for I must tell
you first of all, you musn't count on me
to help you&quot;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;You will have nothing at all to
do, my dear Felicit&eacute;, but the honours
of the house.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I must be getting up every minute&quot;&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;You do it so gracefully,&quot; replied
the husband&mdash;&quot;I will give all the orders,
and Celanire will second me.&quot;</p>

<p>Mademoiselle was enchanted with
the intention of her sire, and threw her
arms round his neck.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yes! papa,&quot; she said, &quot;invite
as many as you can, I will learn to
play some country-dances that we
may have a ball, and finish my head
of Belisarius&mdash;you must get it framed
for the occasion.&quot;</p>

<p>And the little Ascanius whooped
and hollo'd in the middle of the room.
&quot;I shall have tea and punch and
cakes. I'll eat every thing!&quot;</p>

<p>After this conversation M. Lupot
had set to work. He went to his
friends and his friends' friends&mdash;to
people he hardly knew, and invited
them to his party, begging them to
bring any body with them they liked.
M. Lupot had formerly sold rose-coloured
paper to a musician, and drawing
pencils to an artist. He went to
his ancient customers, and pressed them
to come and to bring their professional
friends with them. In short, M.
Lupot was so prodigiously active that
in four days he had run through nearly
the whole of Paris, caught an immense
cold, and spent seven shillings
in cab hire. Giving an entertainment
has its woes as well as its pleasures.</p>

<p>The grand day, or rather the
grand evening, at last arrived. All
the lamps were lighted, and they had
even borrowed some from their neighbours;
for Celanire had discovered
that their own three lamps did not
give light enough both for the public-room
and the supper-room&mdash;(which
on ordinary occasions was a bed-chamber.)
It was the first time that
M. Lupot had borrowed any thing&mdash;but
also it was the first time that M.
Lupot gave a soir&eacute;e.</p>

<p>From the dawn of day M. Lupot
was busy in preparation: He had
ordered in cakes and refreshments;
bought sundry packs of cards, brushed
the tables, and tucked up the curtains.
Madame Lupot had sat all the time
quietly on the sofa, ejaculating from
time to time, &quot;I'm afraid 'twill be a
troublesome business all this receiving
company.&quot;</p>

<p>Celanire had finished her Belisarius,
who was an exact likeness of
Blue Beard, and whom they had honoured
with a Gothic frame, and
placed in a conspicuous part of the
room. Mademoiselle Lupot was dressed
with amazing care. She had a
new gown, her hair plaited <i>&agrave; la Clotilde</i>.
All this must make a great
<a class="pagenum" name="page375" id="page375" title="page375"></a>sensation. Ascanius was rigged out
in his best; but this did not hinder
him from kicking up a dust in the
room, from getting up on the furniture,
handling the cards, and taking
them to make houses; from opening
the cupboards, and laying his fingers
on the cakes.</p>

<p>Sometimes M. Lupot's patience
gave way, and he cried, &quot;Madame, I
beg you'll make your son be quiet.&quot;
But Madame Lupot answered without
turning her head, &quot;Make him quiet
yourself, M. Lupot&mdash;You know very
well it's <i>your</i> business to manage him.&quot;</p>

<p>It was now eight o'clock, and nobody
was yet arrived. Mademoiselle
looked at her father, who looked at
his wife, who looked at her cat. The
father of the family muttered every
now and then&mdash;&quot;Are we to have our
grand soir&eacute;e all to ourselves?&quot; And
he cast doleful looks on his lamps, his
tables, and all his splendid preparations.
Mademoiselle Celanire sighed
and looked at her dress, and then
looked in the mirror. Madame Lupot
was as unmoved as ever, and said,
&quot;Is this what we've turned every
thing topsy-turvy for?&quot; As for little
Ascanius, he jumped about the room,
and shouted, &quot;If nobody comes, what
lots of cakes we shall have!&quot; At last
the bell rang. It is a family from the
Rue St Denis, retired perfumers, who
have only retained so much of their
ancient profession, that they cover
themselves all over with odours.
When they enter the room, you feel
as if a hundred scent-bottles were
opened at once. There is such a smell
of jasmine and vanille, that you have
good luck if you get off without a
headache. Other people drop in. M.
Lupot does not know half his guests,
for many of them are brought by
others, and even these he scarcely
knows the names of. But he is enchanted
with every thing. A young
fashionable is presented to him by
some unknown third party, who says,
&quot;This is one of our first pianists, who
is good enough to give up a great concert
this evening to come here.&quot; The
next is a famous singer, a lion in musical
parties, who is taken out every
where, and who will give one of his
latest compositions, though unfortunately
labouring under a cold. This
man won the first prize at the Conservatory,
an unfledged Boildieu, who
will be a great composer of operas&mdash;when
he can get librettos to his music,
and music to his librettos. The next
is a painter. He has shown at the
exhibition&mdash;he has had wonderful success.
To be sure nobody bought his
pictures, because he didn't wish to
sell them to people that couldn't appreciate
them. In short, M. Lupot
sees nobody in his rooms that is not
first-rate in some way or other. He
is delighted with the thought&mdash;ravished,
transported. He can't find words
enough to express his satisfaction at
having such geniuses in his house. For
their sakes he neglects his old friends&mdash;he
scarcely speaks to them. It seems
the new-comers, people he has never
seen before, are the only people worthy
of his attentions. Madame Lupot is
tired of getting up, curtsying, and
sitting down again. But her daughter
is radiant with joy; her husband goes
from room to room, rubbing his hands,
as if he had bought all Paris, and got
it a bargain. And little Ascanius
never comes out of the bed-room
without his mouth full. But it is not
enough to invite a large party; you
must know how to amuse them; it is
a thing which very few people have
the art of, even those most accustomed
to have soir&eacute;es. In some you
get tired, and you are in great ceremony;
you must restrict yourself to
a conversation that is neither open,
nor friendly, nor amusing. In others,
you are pestered to death by the amphitryon,
who is perhaps endowed
with the bump of music, and won't
leave the piano for fear some one else
should take his place. There are
others fond of cards, who only ask
their friends that they may make up
a table. Such individuals care for
nothing but the game, and don't
trouble themselves whether the rest
of their guests are amused or not.
Ah! there are few homes that know
how to receive their company, or
make every body pleased. It requires
a tact, a cleverness, an absence of
self, which must surely be very unusual
since we see so few specimens
of them in the soir&eacute;es we attend.</p>

<p>M. Lupot went to and fro&mdash;from
the reception-room to the bed-chamber,
and back again&mdash;he smiled, he
bowed, and rubbed his hands. But
the new-comers, who had not come to
his house to see him smile and rub his
hands, began to say, in very audible
whispers, &quot;Ah, well, do people pass
the whole night here looking at each
other? Very delightful&mdash;very!&quot;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page376" id="page376" title="page376"></a>M. Lupot has tried to start a conversation
with a big man in spectacles,
with a neckcloth of great dimensions,
and who makes extraordinary faces as
he looks round on the company. M.
Lupot has been told, that the gentleman
with the large neckcloth is a literary
man, and that he will probably be
good enough to read or recite some
lines of his own composition. The
ancient stationer coughs three times
before venturing to address so distinguished
a character, but says at last&mdash;&quot;Enchanted
to see at my house a
gentleman so&mdash;an author of such&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, you're the host here, are you?&mdash;the
master of the house?&quot;&mdash;said
the man in the neckcloth.</p>

<p>&quot;I flatter myself I am&mdash;with my
wife, of course&mdash;the lady on the sofa&mdash;you
see her? My daughter, sir&mdash;she's
the tall young lady, so upright in
her figure. She designs, and has an
excellent touch on the piano. I have
a son also&mdash;a little fiend&mdash;it was he
who crept this minute between my legs&mdash;he's
an extraordinary clev&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is one thing, sir,&quot; replied
the big man, &quot;that I can't comprehend&mdash;a
thing that amazes me&mdash;and
that is, that people who live in the
Rue Grenetat should give parties.
It is a miserable street&mdash;a horrid street&mdash;covered
eternally with mud&mdash;choked
up with cars&mdash;a wretched part of the
town, dirty, noisy, pestilential&mdash;bah!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And yet, sir, for thirty years I have
lived here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh Lord, sir, I should have died
thirty times over! When people live
in the Rue Grenetat they should give
up society, for you'll grant it is a regular
trap to seduce people into such
an abominable street. I&quot;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>M. Lupot gave up smiling and rubbing
his hands. He moves off from
the big man in the spectacles, whose
conversation had by no means amused
him, and he goes up to a group of
young people who seem examining the
Belisarius of Mademoiselle Celanire.</p>

<p>&quot;They're admiring my daughter's
drawing,&quot; said M. Lupot to himself;
&quot;I must try to overhear what these
artists are saying.&quot; The young people
certainly made sundry remarks
on the performance, plentifully intermixed
with sneers of a very unmistakable
kind.</p>

<p>&quot;Can you make out what the head
is meant for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not I. I confess I never saw any
thing so ridiculous.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's Belisarius, my dear fellow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Impossible!&mdash;it's the portrait of
some grocer, some relation, probably, of
the family&mdash;look at the nose&mdash;the
mouth&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is intolerable folly to put a frame
to such a daub.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They must be immensely silly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, it isn't half so good as the
head of the Wandering Jew at the top
of a penny ballad.&quot;</p>

<p>M. Lupot has heard enough. He
slips off from the group without a
word, and glides noiselessly to the piano.
The young performer who had
sacrificed a great concert to come to
his soir&eacute;e, had sat down to the instrument
and run his fingers over the
notes.</p>

<p>&quot;What a spinnet!&quot; he cried&mdash;&quot;what
a wretched kettle! How can you expect
a man to perform on such a miserable
instrument? The thing is absurd&mdash;hear
this A&mdash;hear this G&mdash;it's like a hurdygurdy&mdash;not
one note of it in tune!&quot; But
the performer stayed at the piano notwithstanding,
and played incessantly,
thumping the keys with such tremendous
force, that every minute a chord
snapped; when such a thing happened&mdash;he
burst into a laugh, and said,
&quot;Good! there's another gone&mdash;there
will soon be none left.&quot;</p>

<p>M. Lupot flushed up to the ears.
He felt very much inclined to say to
the celebrated performer, &quot;Sir, I
didn't ask you here to break all the
chords of my piano. Let the instrument
alone if you don't like it, but
don't hinder other people from playing
on it for our amusement.&quot;</p>

<p>But the good M. Lupot did not venture
on so bold a speech, which would
have been a very sensible speech nevertheless;
and he stood quietly while
his chords were getting smashed,
though it was by no means a pleasant
thing to do.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Celanire goes up to
her father. She is distressed at the
way her piano is treated; she has no
opportunity of playing her air; but
she hopes to make up for it by singing
a romance, which one of their old
neighbours is going to accompany on
the guitar.</p>

<p>It is not without some difficulty that
M. Lupot obtains silence for his daughter's
song. At sight of the old neighbour
and his guitar a smothered laugh
is visible in the assembly. It is undeniable
that the gentleman is not unlike
a respectable Troubadour with a barrel
<a class="pagenum" name="page377" id="page377" title="page377"></a>organ, and that his guitar is like an
ancient harp. There is great curiosity
to hear the old gentleman touch his
instrument. He begins by beating
time with his feet and his head, which
latter movement gives him very much
the appearance of a mandarin that you
sometimes see on a mantelpiece. Nevertheless
Mademoiselle Lupot essays
her ballad; but she can never manage
to overtake her accompanier, who, instead
of following the singer, seems
determined to make no alteration in
the movement of his head and feet.
The ballad is a failure&mdash;Celanire is confused,
she has mistaken her notes&mdash;she
loses her recollection; and, instead of
hearing his daughter's praises, M. Lupot
overhears the young people whispering&mdash;&quot;It
wouldn't do in a beer-shop.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I must order in the tea,&quot; thought
the ex-stationer&mdash;&quot;it will perhaps put
them into good-humour.&quot;</p>

<p>And M. Lupot rushes off to give
instructions to the maid; and that old
individual, who has never seen such a
company before, does not know how to
get on, and breaks cups and saucers
without mercy, in the effort to make
haste.</p>

<p>&quot;Nannette, have you got ready the
other things you were to bring in with
the tea?&mdash;the muffins&mdash;the cakes?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir&quot;&mdash;replied Nannette&mdash;&quot;all
is ready&mdash;every thing will be in in a moment.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But there is another thing I told
you, Nannette&mdash;the sandwiches.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The witches, sir?&mdash;the sand?&quot;&mdash;enquired
the puzzled Nannette.</p>

<p>&quot;It is an English dish&mdash;I explained
it to you before&mdash;slices of bread and
butter, with ham between.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh la, sir!&quot; exclaimed the maid&mdash;&quot;I
have forgotten that rago&ucirc;t&mdash;oh dear!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well&mdash;make haste, Nannette; get
ready some immediately, while my
daughter hands round the tea and
muffins&mdash;you can bring them in on a
tray.&quot;</p>

<p>The old domestic hurries into the
kitchen grumbling at the English dainty,
and cuts some slices of bread and
covers them with butter; but as she
had never thought of the ham, she cogitates
a long time how she can supply
the want of it&mdash;at last, on looking
round, she discovers a piece of beef
that had been left at dinner.</p>

<p>&quot;Pardieu,&quot; she says, &quot;I'll cut some
lumps of this and put them on the
bread. With plenty of salt they'll
pass very well for ham&mdash;they'll drive
me wild with their English dishes&mdash;they
will.&quot;</p>

<p>The maid speedily does as she says,
and then hurries into the room with a
tray covered with her extempore ham
sandwiches.</p>

<p>Every body takes one,&mdash;for they
have grown quite fashionable along
with tea. But immediately there is an
universal murmur in the assembly.
The ladies throw their slices into the
fire, the gentlemen spit theirs on the
furniture, and they cry&mdash;&quot;why the
devil do people give us things like these?&mdash;they're
detestable.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's my opinion, God forgive me!
the man means to feed us with scraps
from the pig-trough,&quot; says another.</p>

<p>&quot;It's a regular do, this soir&eacute;e,&quot; says
a third.</p>

<p>&quot;The tea is disgustingly smoked,&quot;
says a fourth.</p>

<p>&quot;And all the little cakes look as if
they had been fingered before,&quot; says
the fifth.</p>

<p>&quot;Decidedly they wish to poison us,&quot;
says the big man in the neckcloth,
looking very morose.</p>

<p>M. Lupot is in despair. He goes
in search of Nannette, who has hidden
herself in the kitchen; and he busies
himself in gathering up the fragments
of the bread and butter from the floor
and the fireplace.</p>

<p>Madame Lupot says nothing; but
she is in very bad humour, for she has
put on a new cap, which she felt sure
would be greatly admired; and a lady
has come to her and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, madame, what a shocking
head-dress!&mdash;your cap is very old-fashioned&mdash;those
shapes are quite gone
out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And yet, madame,&quot; replies Madame
Lupot, &quot;I bought it, not two
days ago, in the Rue St Martin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, madame&mdash;Is that the street
you go to for the fashions? Go to
Mademoiselle Alexina Larose Carrefous
Gaillon&mdash;you'll get delicious caps
there&mdash;new fashions and every thing
so tasteful: for Heaven's sake, madame,
never put on that cap again. You
look, at least, a hundred.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's worth one's while, truly,&quot;
thought Madame Lupot, &quot;to tire one's
self to death receiving people, to be
treated to such pretty compliments.&quot;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page378" id="page378" title="page378"></a>Her husband, in the meanwhile,
continued his labours in pursuit of the
rejected sandwiches.</p>

<p>The big man in spectacles, who
wondered that people could live in the
Rue Grenetat, had no idea, nevertheless,
of coming there for nothing. He
has seated himself in an arm-chair in
the middle of the room, and informs
the company that he is going to repeat
a few lines of his own to them.&mdash;The
society seems by no means enchanted
with the announcement, but forms itself
in a circle, to listen to the poet.
He coughs and spits, wipes his mouth,
tales a pinch of snuff, sneezes, has
the lamps raised, the doors shut, asks
a tumbler of sugar and water, and
passes his hand through his hair.
After continuing these operations for
some minutes, the literary man at last
begins. He spouts his verses in a
voice enough to break the glasses; before
he has spoken a minute, he has
presented a tremendous picture of
crimes, and deaths, and scaffolds, sufficient
to appal the stoutest hearts, when
suddenly a great crash from the inner
room attracts universal attention. It
is the young Ascanius, who was trying
to get a muffin on the top of a pile of
dishes, and has upset the table, with
muffin, and dishes, and all on his own
head. M. Lupot runs off to ascertain
the cause of the dreadful cries of his
son; the company follow him, not a
little rejoiced to find an excuse for
hearing no more of the poem; and the
poet, deprived in this way of an audience,
gets up in a furious passion,
takes his hat, and rushes from the
room, exclaiming&mdash;&quot;It serves me
right. How could I have been fool
enough to recite good verses in the
Rue Grenetat!&quot;</p>

<p>Ascanius is brought in and roars
lustily, for two of the dishes have been
broken on his nose; and as there is
no chance now, either of poetry or
music, the party have recourse to
cards&mdash;for it is impossible to sit all night
and do nothing.</p>

<p>They make up a table at <i>bouillote</i>,
and another at <i>ecart&eacute;</i>. M. Lupot
takes his place at the latter. He is
forced to cover all the bets when his
side refuses; and M. Lupot, who
never played higher than shilling
stakes in his life, is horrified when they
tell him&mdash;&quot;You must lay down fifteen
francs to equal our stakes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fifteen francs!&quot; says M. Lupot,
&quot;what is the meaning of all this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It means, that you must make up
the stakes of your side, to what we
have put down on this. The master
of the house is always expected to
make up the difference.&quot;</p>

<p>M. Lupot dare not refuse. He lays
down his fifteen francs and loses them;
next game the deficiency is twenty.
In short, in less than half an hour, the
ex-stationer loses ninety francs. His
eyes start out of his head&mdash;he scarcely
knows where he is; and to complete
his misery, the opposite party, in lifting
up the money they have won, upset
one of the lamps he had borrowed
from his neighbours, and smashed it
into fifty pieces.</p>

<p>At last the hour of separation comes.
The good citizen has been anxious for
it for a long time. All his gay company
depart, without even wishing
good-night to the host who has exerted
himself so much for their entertainment.
The family of the Lupots are
left alone; Madame, overcome with
fatigue, and vexed because her cap had
been found fault with; Celanire, with
tears in her eyes, because her music
and Belisarius had been laughed at;
and Ascanius sick and ill, because he
has nearly burst himself with cakes and
muffins; M. Lupot was, perhaps, the
unhappiest of all, thinking of his ninety
francs and the broken lamp. Old Annette
gathered up the crumbs of the
sandwiches, and muttered&mdash;&quot;Do they
think people make English dishes to
have them thrown into the corners of
the room?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's done,&quot; said M. Lupot; &quot;I
shall give no more soir&eacute;es. I begin to
think I was foolish in wishing to leave
my own sphere. When people of the
same class lark and joke each other,
it's all very well; but when you meddle
with your superiors, and they are
uncivil, it hurts your feelings. Their
mockery is an insult, and you don't
get over it soon. My dear Celanire,
I shall decidedly try to marry you to a
stationer.&quot;</p>

<h2>THE WORLD OF LONDON. SECOND SERIES. PART III.</h2>

<h3>THE ARISTOCRACIES OF LONDON LIFE.</h3>

<h3>OF GENTILITY-MONGERING.</h3>

<p>The HEAVY SWELL was recorded in
our last for the admiration and instruction
of remote ages. When the nineteenth
century shall be long out of date,
and centuries in general out of their
<i>teens</i>, posterity will revert to our delineation
of the heavy swell with pleasure
undiminished, through the long
succession of ages yet to come; the
macaroni, the fop, the dandy, will be
forgotten, or remembered only in our
graphic portraiture of the heavy swell.
But the heavy swell is, after all, a
harmless nobody. His curse, his besetting
sin, his <i>monomania</i>, is vanity tinctured
with pride: his weak point can
hardly be called a crime, since it affects
and injures nobody but himself, if, indeed,
it can be said to injure him who
glories in his vocation&mdash;who is the
echo of a sound, the shadow of a shade.</p>

<p>The GENTILITY-MONGERS, on the contrary,
are positively noxious to society,
as well particular as general. There
is a twofold or threefold iniquity in
their goings-on; they sin against society,
their families, and themselves;
the whole business of their lives is a
perversion of the text of Scripture,
which commandeth us, &quot;in whatever
station we are, therewith to be content.&quot;</p>

<p>The gentility-monger is a family
man, having a house somewhere in
Marylebone, or Pancras parish. He is
sometimes a man of independent fortune&mdash;how
acquired, nobody knows;
that is his secret, his mystery. He will
let no one suppose that he has ever
been in trade; because, when a man
intends gentility-mongering, it must
never be known that he has formerly
carried on the tailoring, or the shipping,
or the cheese-mongering, or the
fish-mongering, or any other mongering
than the gentility-mongering. His
house is very stylishly furnished; that
is to say, as unlike the house of a man
of fashion as possible&mdash;the latter having
only things the best of their kind, and
for use; the former displaying every
variety of extravagant gimcrackery,
to impress you with a profound idea of
combined wealth and taste, but which,
to an educated eye and mind only, conveys
a lively idea of ostentation. When
you call upon a gentility-monger, a
broad-shouldered, coarse, ungentlemanlike
footman, in Aurora plushes,
ushers you to a drawing-room, where,
on tables round, and square, and hexagonal,
are set forth jars, porcelain,
china, and delft; shells, spars; stuffed
parrots under bell-glasses; corals, minerals,
and an infinity of trumpery,
among which albums, great, small, and
intermediate, must by no means be
forgotten.</p>

<p>The room is papered with some
<i>splendacious</i> pattern in blue and gold;
a chandelier of imposing gingerbread
depends from the richly ornamented
ceiling; every variety of ottoman,
lounger, settee, is scattered about, so
that to get a chair involves the right-of-search
question; the bell-pulls are
painted in Poonah; there is a Brussels
carpet of flaming colours, curtains with
massive fringes, bad pictures in gorgeous
frames; prints, after Ross, of
her Majesty and Prince Albert, of
course; and mezzotints of the Duke of
Wellington and Sir Robert Peel, for
whom the gentility-monger has a profound
respect, and of whom he talks
with a familiarity showing that it is
not <i>his</i> fault, at least, if these exalted
personages do not admit him to the
honour of their acquaintance.</p>

<p>In fact, you see the drawing-room is
not intended for sitting down in, and
when the lady appears, you are inclined
to believe she never sits down; at least
the full-blown swell of that satin skirt
seems never destined to the compression
of a chair. The conversation is
as usual&mdash;&quot;Have you read the morning
paper?&quot;&mdash;meaning the Court Circular
and fashionable intelligence; &quot;do you
know whether the Queen is at Windsor
or Claremont, and how long her Majesty
intends to remain; whether town is
fuller than it was, or not so full; when
the next Almacks' ball takes place;
whether you were at the last drawing-room,
and which of the fair <i>debutantes</i>
you most admire; whether Tamburini
is to be denied us next year?&quot; with many
<a class="pagenum" name="page380" id="page380" title="page380"></a>lamentations touching the possible defection,
as if the migrations of an
opera thrush were of the least consequence
to any rational creature&mdash;of
course you don't say so, but lament
Tamburini as if he were your father;
&quot;whether it is true that we are to have
the two Fannies, Taglioni and Cerito,
this season; and what a heaven of delight
we shall experience from the united
action of these twenty supernatural
pettitoes.&quot; You needn't express yourself
after this fashion, else you will
shock miss, who lounges near you in
an agony of affected rapture: you must
sigh, shrug your shoulders, twirl your
cane, and say &quot;divine&mdash;yes&mdash;hope it
may be so&mdash;exquisite&mdash;<i>exquisite</i>.&quot; This
naturally leads you to the last new
songs, condescendingly exhibited to you
by miss, if you are <i>somebody</i>, (if <i>nobody</i>,
miss does not appear;) you are
informed that &quot;<i>My heart is like a
pickled salmon</i>&quot; is dedicated to the
Duchess of Mundungus, and thereupon
you are favoured with sundry passages
(out of Debrett) upon the intermarriages,
&amp;c., of that illustrious family;
you are asked whether Bishop is the
composer of &quot;<i>I saw her in a twinkling</i>,&quot;
and whether the <i>minor</i> is not fine?
Miss tells you she has transposed it
from G to C, as suiting her voice better&mdash;whereupon
mamma acquaints you,
that a hundred and twenty guineas for
a harp is moderate, she thinks; you
think so too, taking that opportunity
to admire the harp, saying that you
saw one exactly like it at Lord (any
Lord that strikes you) So-and-So's, in
St James's Square. This produces an
invitation to dinner; and with many
lamentations on English weather, and
an eulogium on the climate of Florence,
you pay your parting compliments,
and take your leave.</p>

<p>At dinner you meet a claret-faced
Irish absentee, whose good society is a
good dinner, and who is too happy to
be asked any where that a good dinner
is to be had; a young silky clergyman,
in black curled whiskers, and a
white <i>choker</i>; one of the meaner fry
of M.P.'s; a person who <i>calls himself</i> a
foreign count; a claimant of a dormant
peerage; a baronet of some sort, not
above the professional; sundry propriety-faced
people in yellow waistcoats,
who say little, and whose social
position you cannot well make out;
half-a-dozen ladies of an uncertain age,
dressed in grand style, with turbans of
imposing <i>tournure</i>; and a young, diffident,
equivocal-looking gent who sits
at the bottom of the table, and whom
you instinctively make out to be a
family doctor, tutor, or nephew, with
expectations. No young ladies, unless
the young ladies of the family, appear
at the dinner-parties of these gentility-mongers;
because the motive of the
entertainment is pride, not pleasure;
and therefore prigs and frumps are in
keeping, and young women with brains,
or power of conversation, would only
distract attention from the grand business
of life, that is to say, dinner; besides,
a seat at table here is an object,
where the expense is great, and nobody
is asked for his or her own sake, but
for an object either of ostentation, interest,
or vanity. Hospitality never
enters into the composition of a gentility-monger:
he gives a dinner, wine,
and a shake of the hand, but does not
know what the word <i>welcome</i> means:
he says, now and then, to his wife
&quot;My dear, I think we must give a
dinner;&quot; a dinner is accordingly determined
on, cards issued three weeks
in advance, that you may be premeditatedly
dull; the dinner is gorgeous to
repletion, that conversation may be
kept as stagnant as possible. Of those
happy surprize invitations&mdash;those unexpected
extemporaneous dinners, that
as they come without thinking or
expectation, so go off with <i>eclat</i>, and
leave behind the memory of a cheerful
evening&mdash;he has no idea; a man of
fashion, whose place is fixed, and who
has only himself to please, will ask
you to a slice of crimped cod and a
hash of mutton, without ceremony;
and when he puts a cool bottle on the
table, after a dinner that he and his
friend have really enjoyed, will never
so much as apologize with, &quot;my dear
sir, I fear you have had a wretched
dinner,&quot; or &quot;I wish I had known: I
should have had something better.&quot;
This affected depreciation of his hospitality
he leaves to the gentility-monger,
who will insist on cramming you with
fish, flesh, and fowls, till you are like
to burst; and then, by way of apology,
get his guests to pay the reckoning in
plethoric laudation of his mountains
of victual.</p>

<p>If you wait in the drawing-room,
kicking your heels for an hour after
the appointed time, although you arrived
to a <i>minute</i>, as every Christian
does, you may be sure that somebody
<a class="pagenum" name="page381" id="page381" title="page381"></a>who patronizes the gentility-monger,
probably the Honourable Mr Sniftky,
is expected, and has not come. It is
vain for you to attempt to talk to your
host, hostess, or miss, who are absorbed,
body and soul, in expectation of Honourable
Sniftky; the propriety-faced
people in the yellow waistcoats attitudinize
in groups about the room,
putting one pump out, drawing the
other in, inserting the thumb gracefully
in the arm-hole of the yellow
waistcoats, and talking <i>icicles</i>; the
young fellows play with a sprig of lily-of-the-valley
in a button-hole&mdash;admire
a flowing portrait of miss, asking one
another if it is not very like&mdash;or hang
over the back of a chair of one of the
turbaned ladies, who gives good evening
parties; the host receives a great many
compliments upon one thing and
another, from some of the professed
diners-out, who take every opportunity
of paying for their dinner beforehand;
every body freezes with the chilling
sensation of dinner deferred, and
&quot;curses, not loud but deep,&quot; are imprecated
on the Honourable Sniftky.
At last, a prolonged <i>rat-tat-tat</i> announces
the arrival of the noble beast,
the lion of the evening; the Honourable
Sniftky, who is a junior clerk in
the Foreign Office, is announced by
the footman out of livery, (for the day,)
and announces himself a minute after:
he comes in a long-tailed coat and
boots, to show his contempt for his
entertainers, and mouths a sort of apology
for keeping his betters waiting,
which is received by the gentility-monger,
his lady, and miss, with nods,
and becks, and wreathed smiles of unqualified
admiration and respect.</p>

<p>As the order of precedence at the
house of a gentility-monger is not
strictly understood, the host desires
Honourable Sniftky to take down miss;
and calling out the names of the other
guests, like muster-master of the
guards, pairs them, and sends them
down to the dining-room, where you
find the nephew, or family doctor, (or
whatever he is,) who has inspected the
arrangement of the table, already in
waiting.</p>

<p>You take your place, not without
that excess of ceremony that distinguishes
the table of a gentility-monger;
the Honourable Sniftky, <i>ex-officio</i>,
takes his place between mamma
and miss, glancing vacancy round the
table, lest any body should think himself
especially honoured by a fixed
stare; covers are removed by the mob
of occasional waiters in attendance,
and white soup and brown soup, thick
and heavy as judges of assize, go circuit.</p>

<p>Then comes hobnobbing, with an
interlocutory dissertation upon a <i>plateau,
candelabrum</i>, or some other superfluous
machine, in the centre of the
table. One of the professed diners-out,
discovers for the twentieth time an
inscription in dead silver on the pedestal,
and enquires with well-affected
ignorance whether that is a <i>present</i>;
the gentility-monger asks the diner-out
to wine, as he deserves, then enters
into a long apologetical self-laudation
of his exertions in behalf of the CANNIBAL
ISLANDS, ABORIGINES, PROTECTION,
AND BRITISH SUBJECT TRANSPORTATION
SOCIETY, (some emigration
crimping scheme, in short,) in which
his humble efforts to diffuse civilization
and promote Christianity, however unworthy,
(&quot;No, no!&quot; from the diner-out,)
gained the esteem of his fellow-labourers,
and the approbation of his
own con&mdash;&mdash;&quot;Shall I send you some
fish, sir?&quot; says the man at the foot of
the table, addressing himself to the
Honourable Sniftky, and cutting short
the oration.</p>

<p>A monstrous salmon and a huge
turbot are now dispensed to the hungry
multitude; the gentility-monger
has no idea that the biggest turbot is
not the best; he knows it is the <i>dearest</i>,
and that is enough for him; he
would have his dishes like his cashbook,
to show at a glance how much
he has at his banker's. When the
flesh of the guests has been sufficiently
fishified, there is an <i>interregnum</i>, filled
up with another circuit of wine, until
the arrival of the <i>pi&egrave;ces de resistance</i>,
the imitations of made dishes, and
the usual <i>etceteras</i>. The conversation,
meanwhile, is carried on in a <i>staccato</i>
style; a touch here, a hit there, a miss
almost every where; the Honourable
Sniftky turning the head of mamma
with affected compliments, and hobnobbing
to himself without intermission.
After a sufficiently tedious interval,
the long succession of wasteful
extravagance is cleared away with the
upper tablecloth; the dowagers, at a
look from our hostess, rise with dignity
and decorously retire, miss modestly
bringing up the rear&mdash;the man at the
foot of the table with the handle of the
<a class="pagenum" name="page382" id="page382" title="page382"></a>door in one hand, and a napkin in the
other, bowing them out.</p>

<p>Now the host sings out to the Honourable
Sniftky to draw his chair
closer and be jovial, as if people, after
an oppressively expensive dinner, can
be jovial <i>to order</i>. The wine goes
round, and laudations go with it; the
professed diners-out enquire the
vintage; the Honourable Mr Sniftky intrenches
himself behind a rampart of
fruit dishes, speaking only when he is
spoken to, and glancing inquisitively
at the several speakers, as much as to
say, &quot;What a fellow you are, to talk;&quot;
the host essays a <i>bon-mot</i>, or tells a
story bordering on the <i>ideal</i>, which he
thinks is fashionable, and shows that
he knows life; the Honourable Sniftky
drinks claret from a beer-glass, and
after the third bottle affects to discover
his mistake, wondering what he
could be thinking of; this produces
much laughter from all save the professed
diners-out, who dare not take
such a liberty, and is <i>the</i> jest of the
evening.</p>

<p>When the drinkers, drinkables, and
talk are quite exhausted, the noise of a
piano recalls to our bewildered
recollections the ladies, and we drink their
healths: the Honourable Sniftky, pretending
that it is foreign-post night at
the Foreign Office, walks off without
even a bow to the assembled diners, the
gentility-monger following him submissively
to the door; then returning,
tells us that he's sorry Sniftky's gone,
he's such a good-natured fellow, while
the gentleman so characterized gets
into his cab, drives to his club, and
excites the commiseration of every
body there, by relating how he was
bored with an old <i>ruffian</i>, who insisted
upon his (Sniftky's) going to dinner
in Bryanston Square; at which there
are many &quot;Oh's!&quot; and &quot;Ah's!&quot; and
&quot;what could you expect?&mdash;Bryanston
Square!&mdash;served you right.&quot;</p>

<p>In the mean time, the guests, relieved
of the presence of the Honourable
Sniftky, are rather more at their ease;
a baronet (who was lord mayor, or
something of that sort) waxes jocular,
and gives decided indications of
something like &quot;how came you so;&quot;
the man at the foot of the table contradicts
one of the diners-out, and is
contradicted in turn by the baronet;
the foreign count is in deep conversation
with a hard-featured man, supposed
to be a stockjobber; the clergyman
extols the labours of the host in
the matter of the Cannibal Islands'
Aborigines Protection Society, in which
his reverence takes an interest; the
claimant of the dormant peerage retails
his pedigree, pulling to pieces the
attorney-general, who has expressed
an opinion hostile to his pretensions.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the piano is joined
by a harp, in musical solicitation of
the company to join the ladies in the
drawing-room; they do so, looking
flushed and plethoric, sink into easy-chairs,
sip tea, the younger beaux turning
over, with miss, Books of Beauty
and Keepsakes: at eleven, coaches and
cabs arrive, you take formal leave, expressing
with a melancholy countenance
your sense of the delightfulness
of the evening, get to your chambers,
and forget, over a broiled bone and a
bottle of Dublin stout, in what an infernal,
prosy, thankless, stone-faced,
yellow-waistcoated, unsympathizing,
unintellectual, selfish, stupid set you
have been condemned to pass an afternoon,
assisting, at the ostentatious exhibition
of vulgar wealth, where gulosity
has been unrelieved by one single
sally of wit, humour, good-nature,
humanity, or charity; where you come
without a welcome, and leave without
a friend.</p>

<p>The whole art of the gentility-mongers
of all sorts in London, and
<i>&agrave; fortiori</i> of their wives and families, is
to lay a tax upon social intercourse
as nearly as possible amounting to a
prohibition; their dinners are criminally
wasteful, and sinfully extravagant
to this end; to this end they
insist on making <i>price</i> the test of what
they are pleased to consider <i>select society</i>
in their own sets, and they consequently
cannot have a dance without
guinea tickets nor a <i>pic-nic</i> without
dozens of champagne. This shows
their native ignorance and vulgarity
more than enough; genteel people go
upon a plan directly contrary, not
merely enjoying themselves, but enjoying
themselves without extravagance
or waste: in this respect the gentility-mongers
would do well to imitate
people of fashion.</p>

<p>The exertions a gentility-monger
will make, to rub his skirts against
people above him; the humiliations,
mortifications, snubbing, he will submit
to, are almost incredible. One
would hardly believe that a retired
tradesman, of immense wealth, and
<a class="pagenum" name="page383" id="page383" title="page383"></a>enjoying all the respect that immense
wealth will secure, should actually
offer large sums of money to a lady of
fashion, as an inducement to procure
for him cards of invitation to her <i>set</i>,
which he stated was the great object
of his existence. Instead of being indignant
at his presumption, the lady
in question, pitying the poor man's
folly, attempted to reason with him,
assuring him with great truth that
whatever might be his wealth, his
power or desire of pleasing, he would
be rendered unhappy and ridiculous,
by the mere dint of pretension to a
circle to which he had no legitimate
claim, and advising him, as a friend,
to attempt some more laudable and
satisfactory ambition.</p>

<p>All this good advice was, however,
thrown away; our gentility-monger
persevered, contriving somehow to
gain a passport to some of the <i>outer</i>
circles of fashionable life; was ridiculed,
laughed at, and honoured with
the <i>soubriquet</i> (he was a pianoforte
maker) of the <i>Semi-Grand</i>!</p>

<p>We know another instance, where
two young men, engaged in trade in
the city, took a splendid mansion at
the West End, furnished it sumptuously,
got some desperate knight or
baronet's widow to give parties at
their house, inviting whomsoever she
thought proper, at their joint expense.
It is unnecessary to say, the poor fellows
succeeded in getting into good
society, not indeed in the <i>Court Circular</i>,
but in the&mdash;<i>Gazette</i>.</p>

<p>There is another class of gentility-mongers
more to be pitied than the
last; those, namely, who are endeavouring
to &quot;make a connexion,&quot; as the
phrase is, by which they may gain advancement
in their professions, and are
continually on the look-out for introductions
to persons of quality, their
hangers-on and dependents. There is
too much of this sort of thing among
medical men in London, the family
nature of whose profession renders
connexion, private partiality, and personal
favour, more essential to them
than to others. The lawyer, for example,
need not be a gentility-monger;
he has only to get round attorneys, for
the opportunity to show what he can
do, when he has done this, in which a
little toadying, &quot;<i>on the sly</i>,&quot; is necessary&mdash;all
the rest is easy. The court
and the public are his judges; his
powers are at once appreciable, his
talent can be calculated, like the money
in his pocket; he can now go on
straight forward, without valuing the
individual preference or aversion of
any body.</p>

<p>But a profession where men make
way through the whisperings of women,
and an inexhaustible variety of
<i>sotto voce</i> contrivances, must needs
have a tendency to create a subserviency
of spirit and of manner, which
naturally directs itself into gentility-mongering:
where realities, such as
medical experience, reading, and skill,
are remotely, or not at all, appreciable,
we must take up with appearances;
and of all appearances, the appearance
of proximity to people of fashion is the
most taking and seductive to people
<i>not</i> of fashion. It is for this reason that
a rising physician, if he happen to have
a lord upon his sick or visiting list,
never has done telling his plebeian patients
the particulars of his noble case,
which they swallow like almond milk,
finding it an excellent <i>placebo</i>.</p>

<p>As it is the interest of a gentility-monger,
and his constant practice, to
be attended by a fashionable physician,
in order that he may be enabled continually
to talk of what Sir Henry
thinks of this, and how Sir Henry objects
to that, and the opinion of Sir
Henry upon t'other, so it is the business
of the struggling doctor to be
a gentility-monger, with the better
chance of becoming one day or other
a fashionable physician. Acting on
this principle, the poor man must necessarily
have a house in a professional
neighbourhood, which usually abuts
upon a neighbourhood fashionable or
exclusive; he must hire a carriage by
the month, and be for ever stepping in
and out of it, at his own door, keeping
it purposely bespattered with mud to
show the extent of his visiting acquaintance;
he must give dinners to people
&quot;who <i>may</i> be useful,&quot; and be continually
on the look-out for those lucky
accidents which have made the fortunes,
and, as a matter of course, the
<i>merit</i>, of so many professional men.</p>

<p>He becomes a Fellow of the Royal
Society, which gives him the chance
of conversing with a lord, and the right
of entering a lord's (the president's)
house, which is turned into sandwich-shop
four times a-year for his
reception; this, being the nearest approach
<a class="pagenum" name="page384" id="page384" title="page384"></a>he makes to acquaintance with
great personages, he values with the importance
it deserves.</p>

<p>His servants, with famine legibly
written on their bones, are assiduous
and civil; his wife, though half-starved,
is very genteel, and at her dinner parties
burns candle-ends from the palace.<a name="footnotetag48" id="footnotetag48"></a><a href="#footnote48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<p>If you pay her a morning visit, you
will have some such conversation as
follows.</p>

<p>&quot;Pray, Mr &mdash;&mdash;, is there any news
to-day?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Great distress, I understand,
throughout the country.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed&mdash;the old story, shocking&mdash;very.&mdash;Pray,
have you heard the delightful
news? The Princess-Royal
has actually cut a tooth!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I assure you; and the sweet
little royal love of a martyr has borne
it like a hero.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Positively?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Positively, I assure you; Doctor
Tryiton has just returned from a consultation
with his friend Sir Henry,
upon a particularly difficult case&mdash;Lord
Scruffskin&mdash;case of elephantiasis
I think they call it, and tells me that
Sir Henry has arrives express from
Windsor with the news.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think, Mr &mdash;&mdash;, there will
be a general illumination?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really, madam, I cannot say.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>There ought to be</i>, [with emphasis.]
You must know, Mr &mdash;&mdash;, Dr
Tryiton has forwarded to a high quarter
a beautifully bound copy of his
work on ulcerated sore throat; he says
there is a great analogy between ulcers
of the throat and den&mdash;den&mdash;den&mdash;something,
I don't know what&mdash;teething,
in short. If nothing comes of it,
Dr Tryiton, thank Heaven, can do without
it; but you know, Mr &mdash;&mdash;, it may,
on a future occasion, be <i>useful to our
family</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>If there is, in the great world of
London, one thing more spirit-sinking
than another, it is to see men condemned,
by the necessities of an overcrowded
profession, to sink to the
meannesses of pretension for a desperate
accident by which they may insure
success. When one has had an
opportunity of being behind the scenes,
and knowing what petty shifts, what
poor expedients of living, what anxiety of
mind, are at the bottom of all this
empty show, one will not longer marvel
that many born for better things should
sink under the difficulties of their position,
or that the newspapers so continually
set forth the miserably unprovided
for condition in which they so
often are compelled to leave their families.
To dissipate the melancholy
that always oppresses us when constrained
to behold the ridiculous antics
of the gentility-mongers, which we
chronicle only to endeavour at a reformation&mdash;let
us contrast the hospitality
of those who, with wiser ambition,
keep themselves, as the saying
is, &quot;<i>to themselves</i>;&quot; and, as a bright
example, let us recollect our old friend
Joe Stimpson.</p>

<p>Joe Stimpson is a tanner and leather-seller
in Bermondsey, the architect of
his own fortune, which he has raised
to the respectable elevation of somewhere
about a quarter of a million
sterling. He is now in his seventy-second
year, has a handsome house,
without and pretension, overlooking
his tanyard. He has a joke upon
prospects, calling you to look from the
drawing-room window at his tanpits,
asking you if you ever saw any thing
like that at the west end of the town;
replying in the negative, Joe, chuckling,
observes that it is the finest prospect <i>he</i>
ever saw in his life, and although he
has been admiring it for half a century,
he has not done admiring it yet.
Joe's capacity for the humorous may
be judged of by this specimen; but in
attention to business few can surpass
him, while his hospitality can command
a wit whenever he chooses to angle for
one with a good dinner. He has a
wife, a venerable old smiling lady in
black silk, neat cap, and polished shoes;
three daughters, unmarried; and a
couple of sons, brought up, after the
London fashion, to inherit their father's
business, or, we might rather say,
<i>estate</i>.</p>

<p>Why the three Miss Stimpsons remain
<a class="pagenum" name="page385" id="page385" title="page385"></a>unmarried, we cannot say, nor
would it be decorous to enquire; but
hearing them drop a hint now and then
about visits, &quot;a considerable time ago,&quot;
to Brighthelmstone and Bath, we are
led, however reluctantly in the case of
ladies <i>now</i> evangelical, to conclude,
their attention has formerly been directed
to gentility-mongering at these
places of fashionable resort; the tanyard
acting as a repellent to husbands
of a social position superior to their
own, and their great fortunes operating
in deterring worthy persons of their
own station from addressing them; or
being the means of inducing them to
be too prompt with refusals, these
amiable middle-aged young ladies are
now &quot;on hands,&quot; paying the penalty
of one of the many curses that pride
of wealth brings in its train. At present,
however, their &quot;affections are set
on things above;&quot; and, without meaning
any thing disrespectful to my
friend Joe Stimpson, Sarah, Harriet,
and Susan Stimpson are certainly the
three least agreeable members of the
family. The sons are, like all other
sons in the houses of their fathers,
steady, business-like, unhappy, and
dull; they look like fledged birds in
the nest of the old ones, out of place;
neither servants nor masters, their
social position is somewhat equivocal,
and having lived all their lives in the
house of their father, seeing as he sees,
thinking as he thinks, they can hardly
be expected to appear more than a
brace of immature Joe Stimpsons.
They are not, it is true, tainted with
much of the world's wickedness, neither
have they its self-sustaining trials,
its hopes, its fears, its honest struggles,
or that experience which is gathered
only by men who quit, when
they can quit it, the petticoat string,
and the paternal despotism of even a
happy home. As for the old couple,
time, although silvering the temples
and furrowing the front, is hardly seen
to lay his heavy hand upon the shoulder
of either, much less to put his
finger on eyes, ears, or lips&mdash;the two
first being yet as &quot;wide awake,&quot; and
the last as open to a joke, or any other
good thing, as ever they were; in sooth,
it is no unpleasing sight to see this
jolly old couple with nearly three half
centuries to answer for, their affection
unimpaired, faculties unclouded, and
temper undisturbed by the near approach,
beyond hope of respite, of that
stealthy foe whose assured advent
strikes terror to us all. Joe Stimpson,
if he thinks of death at all, thinks of
him as a pitiful rascal, to be kicked
down stairs by the family physician;
the Bible of the old lady is seldom far
from her hand, and its consolations
are cheering, calming, and assuring.
The peevish fretfulness of age has nothing
in common with man or wife,
unless when Joe, exasperated with his
evangelical daughters' continual absence
at the class-meetings, and love-feasts,
and prayer-meetings, somewhat
indignantly complains, that &quot;so long as
they can get to heaven, they don't care
who goes to &mdash;&mdash;,&quot; a place that Virgil
and Tasso have taken much pains in
describing, but which the old gentleman
sufficiently indicates by one emphatic
monosyllable.</p>

<p>Joe is a liberal-minded man, hates
cant and humbug, and has no prejudices&mdash;hating
the French he will not acknowledge
is a prejudice, but considers
the bounden duty of an Englishman;
and, though fierce enough upon other
subjects of taxation, thinks no price
too high for drubbing them. He was
once prevailed upon to attempt a journey
to Paris; but having got to Calais,
insisted upon returning by the next
packet, swearing it was a shabby concern,
and he had seen enough of it.</p>

<p>He takes in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine,</i>
because his father did it before
him&mdash;but he never reads it; he takes
pride in a corpulent dog, which is ever
at his heels; he is afflicted with face-ache,
and swears at any body who
calls it <i>tic-douloureux.</i></p>

<p>When you go to dine with him, you
are met at the door by a rosy-checked
lass, with ribands in her cap, who smiles
a hearty welcome, and assures you,
though an utter stranger, of the character
of the house and its owner. You
are conducted to the drawing-room,
a plain, substantial, <i>honest</i>-looking
apartment; there you find the old
couple, and are received with a warmth
that gives assurance of the nearest approach
to what is understood by <i>home</i>.
The sons, released from business, arrive,
shake you heartily by the hand,
and are really glad to see you; of the
daughters we say nothing, as there is
nothing in <i>them</i>.</p>

<p>The other guests of the day come
dropping in&mdash;all straightforward, business-like,
free, frank-hearted fellows&mdash;aristocrats
of wealth, the best, because
<a class="pagenum" name="page386" id="page386" title="page386"></a>the <i>unpretending</i>, of their class; they
come, too, <i>before</i> their time, for they
know their man, and that Joe Stimpson
keeps nobody waiting for nobody.
When the clock&mdash;for here is no <i>gong</i>&mdash;strikes
five, you descend to dinner;
plain, plentiful, good, and well dressed;
no tedious course, with long intervals
between; no oppressive <i>set-out</i> of superfluous
plate, and what, perhaps, is
not the least agreeable accessory, no
piebald footmen hanging over your
chair, whisking away your plate before
you have done with it, and watching
every bit you put into your mouth.</p>

<p>Your cherry-cheeked friend and another,
both in the family from childhood,
(another good sign of the house,)
and looking as if they really were glad&mdash;and
so they are&mdash;to have an opportunity
of obliging you, do the servitorial offices
of the table; you are sure of a glass
of old sherry, and you may call for
strong beer, or old port, with your
cheese&mdash;or, if a Scotchman, for a dram&mdash;without
any other remark than an invitation
to &quot;try it again, and make
yourself comfortable.&quot;</p>

<p>After dinner, you are invited, as a
young man, to smoke a cigar with the
&quot;boys,&quot; as Joe persists in calling
them. You ascend to a bed-room, and
are requested to keep your head out o'
window while smoking, lest the &quot;Governor&quot;
should snuff the fumes when
he comes up stairs to bed: while you
are &quot;craning&quot; your neck, the cherry-cheeked
lass enters with brandy and
water, and you are as merry and easy
as possible. The rest of the evening
passes away in the same unrestrained
interchange of friendly courtesy; nor
are you permitted to take your leave
without a promise to dine on the next
Sunday or holiday&mdash;Mrs Stimpson
rating you for not coming last Easter
Sunday, and declaring she cannot think
&quot;why young men should mope by
themselves, when she is always happy
to see them.&quot;</p>

<p>Honour to Joe Stimpson and his
missus! They have the true <i>ring</i> of
the ancient coin of hospitality; none
of your hollow-sounding <i>raps</i>: they
know they have what I want, <i>a home</i>,
and they will not allow me, at their
board, to know that I want one: they
compassionate a lonely, isolated man,
and are ready to share with him the
hearty cheer and unaffected friendliness
of their English fireside: they
know that they can get nothing by
me, nor do they ever dream of an
acknowledgment for their kindness;
but I owe them for many a social day
redeemed from cheerless solitude;
many an hour of strenuous labour do
I owe to the relaxation of the old wainscotted
dining-room at Bermondsey.</p>

<p>Honour to Joe Stimpson, and to all
who are satisfied with their station,
happy in their home, have no repinings
after empty sounds of rank and shows
of life; and who extend the hand of
friendly fellowship to the homeless,
<i>because they have no home</i>!</p>

<h3>THE ARISTOCRACY OF TALENT.</h3>

<div class="blkquot"><p>&quot;There is a quantity of talent latent among men, ever rising to the level of the great occasions
that call it forth.&quot;</p></div>

<p>This illustration, borrowed by Sir
James Mackintosh from chemical science,
and so happily applied, may serve
to indicate the undoubted truth, that
talent is a <i>growth</i> as much as a <i>gift</i>;
that circumstances call out and develop
its latent powers; that as soil,
flung upon the surface from the uttermost
penetrable depths of earth, will
be found to contain long-dormant
germs of vegetable life, so the mind of
man, acted upon by circumstances,
will ever be found equal to a certain
sum of production&mdash;the amount of
which will be chiefly determined by
the force and direction of the external
influence which first set it in motion.</p>

<p>The more we reflect upon this important
subject, we shall find the more,
that external circumstances have an
influence upon intellect, increasing in
an accumulating ratio; that the political
institutions of various countries
have their fluctuating and contradictory
influences; that example controls
in a great degree intellectual production,
causing after-growths, as it were,
of the first luxuriant crop of masterminds,
and giving a character and
individuality to habits of thought and
modes of expression; in brief, that
great occasions will have great instruments,
and there never was yet a noted
time that had not noted men. Dull,
jog-trot, money-making, commercial
times will make, if they do not find,
<a class="pagenum" name="page387" id="page387" title="page387"></a>dull, jog-trot, money-making, commercial
men: in times when ostentation
and expense are the measures of respect,
when men live rather for the
world's opinion than their own, poverty
becomes not only the evil but
the shame, not only the curse but the
disgrace, and will be shunned by every
man as a pestilence; every one will
fling away immortality, to avoid it;
will sink, as far as he can, his art in
his trade; and <i>he</i> will be the greatest
genius who can turn most money.</p>

<p>It may be urged that true genius
has the power not only to <i>take</i> opportunities,
but to make them: true, it
may make such opportunities as the
time in which it lives affords; but
these opportunities will be great or
small, noble or ignoble, as the time is
eventful or otherwise. All depends
upon the time, and you might as well
have expected a Low Dutch epic poet
in the time of the great herring fishery,
as a Napoleon, a Demosthenes, a Cicero
in this, by some called the nineteenth,
but which we take leave to designate
the &quot;<i>dot-and-carry-one</i>&quot; century. If
a Napoleon were to arise at any corner
of any London street, not five seconds
would elapse until he would be
&quot;<i>hooked</i>&quot; off to the station-house by
Superintendent DOGSNOSE of the D
division, with an exulting mob of men
and boys hooting at his heels: if
Demosthenes or Cicero, disguised as
Chartist orators, mounting a tub at
Deptford, were to Philippicize, or
entertain this motley auditory with
speeches against Catiline or Verres,
straightway the Superintendent of
the X division, with a <i>posse</i> of constables
at his heels, dismounts the
patriot orator from his tub, and hands
him over to a plain-spoken business-like
justice of the peace, who regards
an itinerant Cicero in the same unsympathizing
point of view with any
other vagabond.</p>

<p>What is become of the eloquence of
the bar? Why is it that flowery
orators find no grist coming to their
mills? How came it that, at Westminster
Hall, Charles Philips missed
his market? What is the reason, that
if you step into the Queen's Bench, or
Common Pleas, or Exchequer, you
will hear no such thing as a speech&mdash;behold
no such animal as an orator&mdash;only
a shrewd, plain, hard-working,
steady man, called an attorney-general,
or a sergeant, or a leading counsel,
quietly talking over a matter of law
with the judge, or a matter of fact
with the jury, like men of business as
they are, and shunning, as they would
a rattlesnake, all clap-trap arguments,
figures, flowers, and the obsolete embroidery
of rhetoric?</p>

<p>The days of romantic eloquence are
fled&mdash;the great constitutional questions
that called forth &quot;thoughts that
breathe, and words that burn,&quot; from
men like Erskine, are <i>determined</i>.
Would you have men oratorical over
a bottomry bond, Demosthenic about
an action of trespass on the case, or a
rule to compute?</p>

<p>To be sure, when Follett practised
before committees of the House of
Commons, and, by chance, any question
involving points of interest and
difficulty in Parliamentary law and
practice came before the Court, there
was something worth hearing: the
<i>opportunity</i> drew out the <i>man</i>, and the
<i>orator</i> stepped before the <i>advocate</i>.
Even now, sometimes, it is quite refreshing
to get a topic in these Courts
worthy of Austin, and Austin working
at it. But no man need go to look for
orators in our ordinary courts of law;
judgment, patience, reading, and that
rare compound of qualities known and
appreciated by the name of <i>tact</i>, tell
with judges, and influence juries; the
days of <i>palaver</i> are gone, and the talking
heroes extinguished for ever.</p>

<p>All this is well known in London;
but the three or four millions (it may
be <i>five</i>) of great men, philosophers,
poets, orators, patriots, and the like, in
the rural districts, require to be informed
of this our declension from the
heroics, in order to appreciate, or at
least to understand, the modesty, sobriety,
business-like character, and division
of labour, in the vast amount of
talent abounding in every department
of life in London.</p>

<p>London overflows with talent. You
may compare it, for the purpose of
illustration, to one of George Robins'
patent filters, into which pours turbid
torrents of Thames water, its sediment,
mud, dirt, weeds, and rottenness;
straining through the various <i>strata</i>,
its grosser particles are arrested in
their course, and nothing that is not
pure, transparent, and limpid is transmitted.
In the great filter of London
life, conceit, pretension, small provincial
abilities, <i>pseudo</i>-talent, <i>soi-disant</i>
intellect, are tried, rejected, and flung
<a class="pagenum" name="page388" id="page388" title="page388"></a>out again. True genius is tested by
judgment, fastidiousness, emulation, difficulty,
privation; and, passing through
many ordeals, persevering, makes its
way through all; and at length, in the
fulness of time, flows forth, in acknowledged
purity and refinement, upon the
town.</p>

<p>There is a perpetual onward, upward
tendency in the talent, both high and
low, mechanical and intellectual, that
abounds in London:</p>

<div class="blkquot"><p>&quot;Emulation hath a thousand sons,&quot;</p></div>

<p>who are ever and always following fast
upon your heels. There is no time to
dawdle or linger on the road, no
&quot;stop and go on again:&quot; if you but
step aside to fasten your shoe-tie, your
place is occupied&mdash;you are edged off,
pushed out of the main current, and
condemned to circle slowly in the lazy
eddy of some complimenting clique.
Thousands are to be found, anxious
and able to take your place; while
hardly one misses you, or turns his
head to look after you should you lose
your own: you <i>live</i> but while you
<i>labour</i>, and are no longer remembered
than while you are reluctant to repose.</p>

<p>Talent of all kinds brings forth
perfect fruits, only when concentrated
upon one object: no matter how versatile
men may be, mankind has a wise
and salutary prejudice against diffused
talent; for although <i>knowledge</i> diffused
immortalizes itself, diffused <i>talent</i> is
but a shallow pool, glittering in the
noonday sun, and soon evaporated;
<i>concentrated</i>, it is a well, from whose
depths perpetually may we draw the
limpid waters. Therefore is the talent
of London concentrated, and the division
of labour minute. When we talk
of a lawyer, a doctor, a man of letters,
in a provincial place, we recognize at
once a man who embraces all that his
opportunities present him with, in
whatever department of his profession.
The lawyer is, at one and the same
time, advocate, chamber counsel, conveyancer,
pleader; the doctor an accoucheur,
apothecary, physician, surgeon,
dentist, or at least, in a greater
or less degree, unites in his own person,
these&mdash;in London, distinct and separate&mdash;professions,
according as his
sphere of action is narrow or extended;
the country journalist is sometimes proprietor,
editor, sub-editor, traveller, and
canvasser, or two or more of these
heterogeneous and incompatible avocations.
The result is, an obvious,
appreciable, and long-established superiority
in that product which is the
result of minutely divided labour.</p>

<p>The manufacture of a London watch
or piano will employ, each, at least
twenty trades, exclusive of the preparers,
importers, and venders of the
raw material used in these articles;
every one of these tradesmen shall be
nay, <i>must</i> be, the best of their class, or
at least the best that can be obtained;
and for this purpose, the inducements
of high wages are held out to workmen
generally, and their competition
for employment enables the manufacturer
to secure the most skilful. It
is just the same with a broken-down
constitution, or a lawsuit: the former
shall be placed under the care of a
lung-doctor, a liver-doctor, a heart-doctor,
a dropsy-doctor, or whatever
other doctor is supposed best able to
understand the case; each of these
doctors shall have read lectures and
published books, and made himself
known for his study and exclusive attention
to one of the &quot;thousand ills
that flesh is heir to:&quot; the latter shall
go through the hands of dozens of
men skilful in that branch of the law
connected with the particular injury.
So it is with every thing else of production,
mechanical or intellectual, or
both, that London affords: the extent
of the market permits the minute division
of labour, and the minute division
of labour reacts upon the market,
raising the price of its produce, and
branding it with the signs of a legitimate
superiority.</p>

<p>Hence the superior intelligence of
working men, of all classes, high and
low, in the World of London; hence
that striving after excellence, that
never-ceasing tendency to advance in
whatever they are engaged in, that so
distinguishes the people of this wonderful
place; hence the improvements
of to-day superseded by the improvements
of to-morrow; hence speculation,
enterprize, unknown to the inhabitants
of less extended spheres of
action.</p>

<p>Competition, emulation, and high
wages give us an aristocracy of talent,
genius, skill, <i>tact</i>, or whatever you like
to call it; but you are by no means to
understand that any of these aristocracies,
or better classes, stand prominently
before their fellows <i>socially</i>, or,
that one is run after in preference to
<a class="pagenum" name="page389" id="page389" title="page389"></a>another; nobody runs after anybody
in the World of London.</p>

<p>In this respect, no capital, no country
on the face of the earth, resembles us;
every where else you will find a leading
class, giving a tone to society, and
moulding it in some one or other direction;
a predominating <i>set</i>, the pride of
those who are <i>in</i>, the envy of those who
are <i>below</i> it. There is nothing of this
kind in London; here every man has
his own set, and every man his proper
pride. In every set, social or professional,
there are great names, successful
men, prominent; but the set is
nothing the greater for them: no man
sheds any lustre upon his fellows, nor
is a briefless barrister a whit more
thought of because he and Lyndhurst
are of the same profession.</p>

<p>Take a look at other places: in
money-getting places, you find society
following, like so many dogs, the aristocracy
of 'Change: every man knows
the worth of every other man, that is
to say, <i>what</i> he is worth.</p>

<p>A good man, elsewhere a relative
term, is <i>there</i> a man good for <i>so</i> much;
hats are elevated and bodies depressed
upon a scale of ten thousand pounds
to an inch; &quot;I hope you are well,&quot;
from one of the aristocracy of these
places is always translated to mean,
&quot;I hope you are solvent,&quot; and &quot;how
d'ye do?&quot; from another, is equivalent
to &quot;doing a bill.&quot;</p>

<p>Go abroad, to Rome for example&mdash;You
are smothered beneath the petticoats
of an ecclesiastical aristocracy.
Go to the northern courts of Europe&mdash;You
are ill-received, or perhaps not received
at all, save in military uniform;
the aristocracy of the epaulet meets
you at every turn, and if you are not
at least an ensign of militia, you are nothing.
Make your way into Germany&mdash;What
do you find there? an aristocracy
of functionaries, mobs of nobodies
living upon everybodies; from
Herr Von, Aulic councillor, and Frau
Von, Aulic councilloress, down to
Herr Von, crossing-sweeper, and Frau
Von, crossing-sweeperess&mdash;for the women
there must be <i>better</i>-half even in
their titles&mdash;you find society led, or,
to speak more correctly, society <i>consisting</i>
of functionaries, and they, every
office son of them, and their wives&mdash;nay,
their very curs&mdash;alike insolent and
dependent. &quot;Tray, Blanche, and
Sweetheart, see they bark at <i>me</i>!&quot;
There, to get into society, you must
first get into a place: you must contrive
to be the <i>servant</i> of the public
before you are permitted to be the
<i>master</i>: you must be paid by, before
you are in a condition to despise, the
<i>canaille</i>.</p>

<p>Passing Holland and Belgium as
more akin to the genius of the English
people, as respects the supremacy of
honest industry, its independent exercise,
and the comparative insignificance
of aristocracies, conventionally
so called, we come to FRANCE: there
we find a provincial and a Parisian
aristocracy&mdash;the former a servile mob
of placemen, one in fifty, at least, of
the whole population; and the latter&mdash;oh!
my poor head, what a <i>clanjaffrey</i>
of <i>journalistes, feuilletonistes, artistes</i>,
dramatists, novelists, <i>vaudivellistes</i>,
poets, literary ladies, lovers of literary
ladies, <i>hommes de lettres, claqueurs,
litt&eacute;rateurs, g&eacute;rants, censeurs, rapporteurs</i>,
and <i>le diable boiteux</i> verily
knows what else!</p>

<p>These people, with whom, or at least
with a great majority of whom, common
sense, sobriety of thought, consistency
of purpose, steady determination
in action, and sound reasoning,
are so sadly eclipsed by their vivacity,
<i>empressement</i>, prejudice, and party zeal,
form a prominent, indeed, <i>the</i> prominent
aristocracy of the <i>salons</i>: and
only conceive what must be the state
of things in France, when we know
that Paris acts upon the provinces, and
that Paris is acted upon by this foolscap
aristocracy, without station, or,
what is perhaps worse, enjoying station
without property; abounding in
maddening and exciting influences,
but lamentably deficient in those hard-headed,
<i>ungenius-like</i> qualities of patience,
prudence, charity, forbearance,
and peace-lovings, of which their war-worn
nation, more than any other in
Europe, stands in need.</p>

<p>When, in the name of goodness, is
the heart of the philanthropist to be
gladdened with the desire of peace fulfilled
over the earth? When are paltry
family intrigues to cease, causing the
blood of innocent thousands to be shed?
When will the aristocracy of genius in
France give over jingling, like castanets,
their trashy rhymes &quot;<i>gloire</i>&quot; and
&quot;<i>victoire</i>,&quot; and apply themselves to objects
worthy of creatures endowed with
the faculty of reason? Or, if they must
<a class="pagenum" name="page390" id="page390" title="page390"></a>have fighting, if it is their nature, if
the prime instinct with them is the
thirst of human blood, how cowardly,
how paltry, is it to hound on their
fellow-countrymen to war with England,
to war with Spain, to war with
every body, while snug in their offices,
doing their little best to bleed nations
with their pen!</p>

<p>Why does not the foolscap aristocracy
rush forth, inkhorn in hand,
and restore the glories (as they call
them) of the Empire, nor pause till they
mend their pens victorious upon the
brink of the Rhine.</p>

<p>To resume: the aristocracies of our
provincial capitals are those of literature
in the one, and lickspittling in
the other: mercantile towns have their
aristocracies of money, or muckworm
aristocracies: Rome has an ecclesiastical&mdash;Prussia,
Russia, military aristocracies:
Germany, an aristocracy of
functionaries: France has two, or even
three, great aristocracies&mdash;the military,
place-hunting, and foolscap.</p>

<p>Now, then, attend to what we are
going to say: London is cursed with
no predominating, no overwhelming,
no <i>characteristic</i> aristocracy. There is
no <i>set</i> or <i>clique</i> of any sort or description
of men that you can point to, and
say, that's the London set. We turn
round and desire to be informed what set
do you mean: every <i>salon</i> has its set, and
every pot-house its set also; and the
frequenters of each set are neither envious
of the position of the other, nor
dissatisfied with their own: the pretenders
to fashion, or hangers-on upon
the outskirts of high life, are alone the
servile set, or spaniel set, who want
the proper self-respecting pride which
every distinct aristocracy maintains in
the World of London.</p>

<p>We are a great firmament, a moonless
azure, glowing with stars of all
magnitudes, and myriads of <i>nebul&aelig;</i> of
no magnitudes at all: we move harmoniously
in our several orbits, minding
our own business, satisfied with
our position, thinking, it may be, with
harmless vanity, that we bestow more
light upon earth than any ten, and that
the eyes of all terrestrial stargazers
are upon us. Adventurers, pretenders,
and quacks, are our meteors, our <i>auror&aelig;</i>,
our comets, our falling-stars, shooting
athwart our hemisphere, and exhaling
into irretrievable darkness: our
tuft-hunters are satellites of Jupiter,
invisible to the naked eye: our clear
frosty atmosphere that sets us all a-twinkling
is prosperity, and we, too
have our clouds that hide us from the
eyes of men. The noonday of our own
bustling time beholds us dimly; but
posterity regards us as it were from the
bottom of a well. Time, that exact
observer, applies his micrometer to
every one of us, determining our rank
among celestial bodies without appeal
and from time to time enrolling in his
<i>ephemeris</i> such new luminaries as may
be vouchsafed to the long succession
of ages.</p>

<p>If there is one thing that endears
London to men of superior order&mdash;to
true aristocrats, no matter of what species,
it is that universal equality of
outward condition, that republicanism
of everyday life, which pervades the
vast multitudes who hum, and who
drone, who gather honey, and who,
without gathering, consume the products
of this gigantic hive. Here you
can never be extinguished or put out
by any overwhelming interest.</p>

<p>Neither are we in London pushed
to the wall by the two or three hundred
great men of every little place.
We are not invited to a main of small
talk with the cock of his own dung-hill;
we are never told, as a great
favour, that Mr Alexander Scaldhead,
the phrenologist, is to be there, and
that we can have our &quot;bumps&quot; felt for
nothing; or that the Chevalier Doembrownski
(a London pickpocket in disguise)
is expected to recite a Polish
ode, accompanying himself on the
Jew's harp; we are not bored with the
misconduct of the librarian, who <i>never</i>
has the first volume of the last new
novel, or invited to determine whether
Louisa Fitzsmythe or Angelina Stubbsville
deserves to be considered the heroine;
we are not required to be in
raptures because Mrs Alfred Shaw or
Clara Novello are expected, or to break
our hearts with disappointment because
they didn't come: the arrival,
performances, and departure, of Ducrow's
horses, or Wombwell's wild
beasts, affect us with no extraordinary
emotion; even Assizes time concerns
most of us nothing.</p>

<p>Then, again, how vulgar, how commonplace
in London is the aristocracy
of wealth; of Mrs Grub, who, in a
provincial town, keeps her carriage,
and is at once the envy and the scandal
<a class="pagenum" name="page391" id="page391" title="page391"></a>of all the Ladies who have to proceed
upon their ten toes, we wot not
the existence. Mr Bill Wright, the
banker, the respected, respectable, influential,
twenty per cent Wright, in
London is merely a licensed dealer in
money; he visits at Camberwell Hill,
or Hampstead Heath, or wherever
other tradesmen of his class delight to
dwell; his wife and daughters patronize
the Polish balls, and Mr Bill
Wright, jun., sports a stall at the
(English) opera; we are not overdone
by Mr Bill Wright, overcome by Mrs
Bill Wright, or the Misses Bill Wright,
nor overcrowed by Mr Bill Wright
the younger: in a word, we don't care
a crossed cheque for the whole Bill
Wrightish connexion.</p>

<p>What are carriages, or carriage-keeping
people in London? It is not
here, as in the provinces, by their carriages
shall you know them; on the
contrary, the carriage of a duchess is
only distinguishable from that of a
<i>parvenu</i>, by the superior expensiveness
and vulgarity of the latter.</p>

<p>The vulgarity of ostentatious wealth
with us, defeats the end it aims at.
That expense which is lavished to impress
us with awe and admiration,
serves only as a provocative to laughter,
and inducement to contempt;
where great wealth and good taste go
together, we at once recognize the harmonious
adaptation of means and ends;
where they do not, all extrinsic and
adventitious expenditure availeth its
disbursers nothing.</p>

<p>What animal on earth was ever so
inhumanly preposterous as a lord
mayor's footman, and yet it takes
sixty guineas, at the least, to make that
poor lick-plate a common laughing-stock?</p>

<p>No, sir; in London we see into, and
see through, all sorts of pretension:
the pretension of wealth or rank, whatever
kind of quackery and imposture.
When I say <i>we</i>, I speak of the vast
multitudes forming the educated, discriminating,
and thinking classes of
London life. We pass on to <i>what</i> a
man <i>is</i>, over <i>who</i> he is, and what he
<i>has</i>; and, with one of the most accurate
observers of human character and
nature to whom a man of the world
ever sat for his portrait&mdash;the inimitable
La Bruyere&mdash;when offended with
the hollow extravagance of vulgar
riches, we exclaim&mdash;&quot;<i>Tu te trompes,
Philemon, si avec ce carrosse brillant,
ce grand nombre de coquins qui te suivent,
et ces six b&ecirc;tes qui te trainent, tu
penses qu'on t'en estime d'avantage: ou
ecarte tout cet attirail qui t'est &eacute;tranger,
pour p&eacute;n&eacute;trer jusq'a toi qui n'es qu'un
fat</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>In London, every man is responsible
for himself, and his position is the
consequence of his conduct. If a great
author, for example, or artist, or politician,
should choose to outrage the
established rules of society in any essential
particular, he is neglected and
even shunned in his private, though
he may be admired and lauded in his
public capacity. Society marks the
line between the <i>public</i> and the <i>social</i>
man; and this line no eminence, not
even that of premier minister of England,
will enable a public man to confound.</p>

<p>Wherever you are invited in London
to be introduced to a great man,
by any of his parasites or hangers-on,
you may be assured that your great
man is no such thing; you may make
up your mind to be presented to some
quack, some hollow-skulled fellow,
who makes up by little arts, small tactics,
and every variety of puff, for the
want of that inherent excellence which
will enable him to stand alone. These
gentlemen form the Cockney school
proper of art, literature, the drama,
every thing; and they go about seeking
praise, as a goatsucker hunts insects,
with their mouths wide open;
they pursue their prey in troops, like
Jackals, and like them, utter at all
times a melancholy, complaining howl;
they imagine that the world is in a
conspiracy not to admire them, and
they would bring an action against the
world if they could. But as that is
impossible, they are content to rail
against the world in good set terms;
they are always puffing in the papers,
but in a side-winded way, yet you can
trace them always at work, through the
daily, weekly, monthly periodicals, in
desperate exertion to attract public
attention. They have at their head one
sublime genius, whom they swear by,
and they admire him the more, the
more incomprehensible and oracular
he appears to the rest of mankind.</p>

<p>These are the men who cultivate extensive
tracts of forehead, and are
deeply versed in the effective display
of depending ringlets and ornamental
whiskers; they dress in black, with
white <i>chokers</i>, and you will be sure to
<a class="pagenum" name="page392" id="page392" title="page392"></a>find a lot of them at evening parties
of the middling sort of doctors, or the
better class of boarding-houses.</p>

<p>This class numbers not merely literary
men, but actors, artists, adventuring
politicians, small scientifics, and
a thousand others, who have not energy
or endurance to work their way in
solitary labour, or who feel that they
do not possess the power to go alone.</p>

<p>Public men in London appear naked
at the bar of public opinion; laced
coats, ribands, embroidery, titles, avail
nothing, because these things are common,
and have the common fate of
common things, to be cheaply estimated.
The eye is satiated with them,
they come like shadows, so depart;
but they do not feed the eye of the
mind; the understanding is not the
better for such gingerbread; we are
compelled to look out for some more
substantial nutriment, and we try the
inward man, and test his capacity.
Instead of measuring his bumps, like a
landsurveyor, we dissect his brain,
like an anatomist; we estimate him,
whether he be high or low, in whatever
department of life, not by what
he says he can do, or means to do, but
by what he <i>has</i> done. By this test is
every man of talent tried in London;
this is his grand, his formal difficulty,
to get the opportunity of showing what
he can do, of being put into circulation,
of having the chance of being
tested, like a shilling, by the <i>ring</i> of
the customer and the <i>bite</i> of the critic;
for the opportunity, the chance to
edge in, the chink to <i>wedge</i> in, the
<i>purchase</i> whereon to work the length
of his lever, he must be ever on the
watch; for the sunshine blink of encouragement,
the April shower of
praise, he must await the long winter
of &quot;hope deferred&quot; passing away. Patience,
the <i>courage</i> of the man of talent,
he must exert for many a dreary
and unrewarded day; he must see the
quack and the pretender lead an undiscerning
public by the nose, and say
nothing; nor must he exult when the
too-long enduring public at length
kicks the pretender and the quack
into deserved oblivion. From many a
door that will hereafter gladly open for
him, he must be content to be presently
turned away. Many a scanty
meal, many a lonely and unfriended
evening, in this vast wilderness, must
he pass in trying on his armour, and
preparing himself for the fight that he
still believes <i>will</i> come, and in which
his spirit, strong within him, tells him
he must conquer. While the night
yet shrouds him he must labour, and
with patient, and happily for him, if,
with religious hope, he watch the first
faint glimmerings of the dawning day;
for his day, if he is worthy to behold
it, will come, and he will yet be recompensed
&quot;by that time and chance
which happeneth to all.&quot; And if his
heart fails him, and his coward spirit
turns to flee, often as he sits, tearful,
in the solitude of his chamber, will the
remembrance of the early struggles of
the immortals shame that coward spirit.
The shade of the sturdy Johnson,
hungering, dinnerless, will mutely reproach
him for sinking thus beneath
the ills that the &quot;scholar's life assail.&quot;
The kindly-hearted, amiable Goldsmith,
pursued to the gates of a prison
by a mercenary wretch who fattened
upon the produce of that lovely mind,
smiling upon him, will bid him be of
good cheer. A thousand names, that
fondly live in the remembrance of our
hearts, will he conjure up, and all will
tell the same story of early want, and
long neglect, and lonely friendlessness.
Then will reproach himself, saying,
&quot;What am I, that I should quail before
the misery that broke not minds
like these? What am I, that I should
be exempt from the earthly fate of the
immortals?&quot;</p>

<p>Nor marvel, then, that men who
have passed the fiery ordeal, whose
power has been tried and not found
wanting, whose nights of probation,
difficulty, and despair are past, and
with whom it is now noon, should
come forth, with deportment modest
and subdued, exempt from the insolent
assumption of vulgar minds, and their
yet more vulgar hostilities and friendships:
that such men as Campbell
and Rogers, and a thousand others in
every department of life and letters,
should partake of that quietude of
manner, that modesty of deportment,
that compassion for the unfortunate of
their class, that unselfish admiration
for men who, successful, have deserved
success, that abomination of cliques,
coteries, and <i>conversazion&eacute;s</i>, and all
the littleness of inferior fry: that such
men should have parasites, and followers,
and hangers-on; or that, since men
like themselves are few and far between,
they should live for and with
such men alone.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page393" id="page393" title="page393"></a>But thou, O Vanity! thou curse, thou
shame, thou sin, with what tides of
<i>pseudo</i> talent hast thou not filled this
ambitious town? Ass, dolt, miscalculator,
quack, pretender, how many
hast thou befooled, thou father of multifarious
fools? Serpent, tempter, evil
one, how many hast thou seduced
from the plough tail, the carpenter's
bench, the schoolmaster's desk, the
rural scene, to plunge them into misery
and contempt in this, the abiding-place
of their betters, thou unhanged
cheat? Hence the querulous piping
against the world and the times, and
the neglect of genius, and appeals to
posterity, and damnation of managers,
publishers, and the public; hence
cliques, and <i>claqueurs</i>, and coteries, and
the would-if-I-could-be aristocracy of
letters; hence bickerings, quarellings,
backbitings, slanderings, and reciprocity
of contempt; hence the impossibility
of literary union, and the absolute
necessity imposed upon the great
names of our time of shunning, like a
pestilence, the hordes of vanity-struck
individuals who would tear the coats
off their backs in desperate adherence
to the skirts. Thou, too, O Vanity!
art responsible for greater evils:&mdash;Time
misspent, industry misdirected,
labour unrequited, because uselessly or
imprudently applied: poverty and isolation,
families left unprovided for,
pensions, solicitations, patrons, meannesses,
subscriptions!</p>

<p>True talent, on the contrary, in
London, meets its reward, if it lives to
be rewarded; but it has, of its own
right, no <i>social</i> pre-eminence, nor is
it set above or below any of the other
aristocracies, in what we may take the
liberty of calling its private life. In
this, as in all other our aristocracies,
men are regarded not as of their set,
but as of themselves: they are <i>individually</i>
admired, not worshipped as a
congregation: their social influence is
not aggregated, though their public
influence may be. When a man, of
whatever class, leaves his closet, he is
expected to meet society upon equal
terms: the scholar, the man of rank,
the politician, the <i>millionaire</i>, must
merge in the gentleman: if he chooses
to individualize his aristocracy in his
own person, he must do so at home,
for it will not be understood or submitted
to any where else.</p>

<p>The rewards of intellectual labour
applied to purposes of remote, or not
immediately appreciable usefulness, as
in social literature, and the loftier
branches of the fine arts, are, with us,
so few, as hardly to be worth mentioning,
and pity 'tis that it should be so.
The law, the church, the army, and
the faculty of physic, have not only
their fair and legitimate remuneration
for independent labour, but they have
their several prizes, to which all who
excel, may confidently look forward
when the time of weariness and exhaustion
shall come; when the pressure of
years shall slacken exertion, and diminished
vigour crave some haven of repose,
or, at the least, some mitigated
toil, with greater security of income:
some place of honour with repose&mdash;the
ambition of declining years. The
influence of the great prize of the law,
the church, and other professions in
this country, has often been insisted
upon with great reason: it has been
said, and truly said, that not only do
these prizes reward merit already
passed through its probationary stages,
but serve as inducements to all who
are pursuing the same career. It is not
so much the example of the prize-holder,
as the <i>prize</i>, that stimulates
men onward and upward: without the
hope of reaching one of those comfortable
stations, hope would be extinguished,
talent lie fallow, energy be
limited to the mere attainment of subsistence;
great things would not be
done, or attempted, and we would
behold only a dreary level of indiscriminate
mediocrity. If this be true of
professions, in which, after a season
of severe study, a term of probation,
the knowledge acquired in early life
sustains the professor, with added experience
of every day, throughout the
rest of his career, with how much more
force will it apply to professions or
pursuits, in which the mind is perpetually
on the rack to produce novelties,
and in which it is considered
derogatory to a man to reproduce his
own ideas, copy his own pictures, or
multiply, after the same model, a variety
of characters and figures!</p>

<p>A few years of hard reading, constant
attention in the chambers of the
conveyancer, the equity craftsman,
the pleader, and a few years more of
that disinterested observance of the
practice of the courts, which is
liberally afforded to every young barrister,
and indeed which many enjoy throughout
life, and he is competent, with
<a class="pagenum" name="page394" id="page394" title="page394"></a>moderate talent, to protect the interests
of his client, and with moderate mental
labour to make a respectable figure in
his profession. In like manner, four
or five years sedulous attendance on
lectures, dissections, and practice of
the hospitals, enables your physician
to see how little remedial power exists
in his boasted art; knowing this, he
feels pulses, and orders a recognized
routine of draughts and pills with the
formality which makes the great secret
of his profession. When the patient
dies, nature, of course, bears the
blame; and when nature, happily uninterfered
with, recovers his patient,
the doctor stands on tiptoe. Henceforward
his success is determined by
other than medical sciences: a pillbox
and pair, a good house in some
recognized locality, Sunday dinners, a
bit of a book, grand power of head-shaking,
shoulder-shrugging, bamboozling
weak-minded men and women,
and, if possible, a religious connexion.</p>

<p>For the clergyman, it is only necessary
that he should be orthodox,
humble, and pious; that he should on
no occasion, right or wrong, set himself
in opposition to his ecclesiastical
superiors; that he should preach unpretending
sermons; that he should
never make jokes, nor understand the
jokes of another: this is all that he
wants to get on respectably. If he is
ambitious, and wishes one of the great
prizes, he must have been a free-thinking
reviewer, have written pamphlets,
or made a fuss about the Greek
particle, or, what will avail him more
than all, have been tutor to a minister
of state.</p>

<p>Thus you perceive, for men whose
education is <i>intellectual</i>, but whose
practice is more or less <i>mechanical</i>,
you have many great, intermediate,
and little prizes in the lottery of life;
but where, on the contrary, are the
prizes for the historian, transmitting
to posterity the events, and men, and
times long since past; where the prize
of the analyst of mind, of the dramatic,
the epic, or the lyric poet, the essayist,
and all whose works are likely
to become the classics of future times;
where the prize of the public journalist,
who points the direction of public
opinion, and, himself without place,
station, or even name, teaches Governments
their duty, and prevents Ministers
of State becoming, by hardihood
or ignorance, intolerable evils; where
the prize of the great artist, who has
not employed himself making faces for
hire, but who has worked in loneliness
and isolation, living, like Barry, upon
raw apples and cold water, that he
might bequeath to his country some
memorial worthy the age in which he
lived, and the art <i>for</i> which he lived?
For these men, and such as these, are
no prizes in the lottery of life; a grateful
country sets apart for them no
places where they can retire in the
full enjoyment of their fame; condemned
to labour for their bread, not
in a dull mechanical routine of professional,
official, or business-like
duties, but in the most severe, most
wearing of all labour, <i>the labour of
the brain</i>, they end where they begun.
With struggling they begin life, with
struggling they make their way in life,
with struggling they end life; poverty
drives away friends, and reputation
multiplies enemies. The man whose
thoughts will become the thoughts
of our children, whose minds will be
reflected in the mirror of <i>his</i> mind,
who will store in their memories his
household words, and carry his lessons
in their hearts, dies not unwillingly,
for he has nothing in life to look forward
to; closes with indifference his
eyes on a prospect where no gleam of
hope sheds its sunlight on the broken
spirit; he dies, is borne by a few humble
friends to a lowly sepulchre, and
the newspapers of some days after
give us the following paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;We regret to be obliged to state
that Dr &mdash;&mdash;, or &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, Esq. (as
the case may be) died, on Saturday
last at his lodgings two pair back
in Back Place, Pimlico, (or) at his
cottage (a miserable cabin where he
retired to die) at Kingston-upon-Thames.
It is our melancholy duty
to inform our readers that this highly
gifted and amiable man, who for so
many years delighted and improved the
town, and who was a most strenuous
supporter of the (Radical or Conservative)
cause, (<i>it is necessary to set
forth this miserable statement to awaken
the gratitude of faction towards the family
of the dead</i>,) has left a rising family
totally unprovided for. We are satisfied
that it is only necessary to allude to
this distressing circumstance, in order
to enlist the sympathies, &amp;c. &amp;c., (in
short, <i>to get up a subscription</i>).&quot;</p>

<p>We confess we are at a loss to understand
why the above advertisement
<a class="pagenum" name="page395" id="page395" title="page395"></a>should be kept stereotyped, to be inserted
with only the interpolation of
name and date, when any man dies who
has devoted himself to pursuits of a
purely intellectual character. Nor are
we unable to discover in the melancholy,
and, as it would seem, unavoidable
fates of such men, substantial
grounds of that diversion of the aristocracy
of talent to the pursuit of professional
distinction, accompanied by
profit, of which our literature, art, and
science are now suffering, and will
continue to suffer, the consequences.</p>

<p>In a highly artificial state of society,
where a command, not merely of the
essentials, but of some of the superfluities
of life are requisite as passports
to society, no man will willingly devote
himself to pursuits which will
render him an outlaw, and his family
dependent on the tardy gratitude of
an indifferent world. The stimulus of
fame will be inadequate to maintain
the energies even of <i>great</i> minds, in a
contest of which the victories are
wreaths of barren bays. Nor will any
man willingly consume the morning
of his days in amassing intellectual
treasures for posterity, when his
contemporaries behold him dimming
with unavailing tears his twilight
of existence, and dying with the worse
than deadly pang, the consciousness
that those who are nearest and dearest
to his heart must eat the bread of
charity. Nor is it quite clear to our
apprehension, that the prevalent system
of providing for merely intellectual
men, by a State annuity or pension,
is the best that can be devised:
it is hard that the pensioned aristocracy
of talent should be exposed to the
taunt of receiving the means of their
subsistence from this or that minister,
upon suppositions of this or that
ministerial assistance which, whether
true or false, cannot fail to derogate
from that independent dignity of mind
which is never extinguished in the
breast of the true aristocrat of talent,
save by unavailing struggles, long-continued,
with the unkindness of fortune.</p>

<p>We wish the aristocracy of power to
think over this, and so very heartily
bid them farewell.</p>

<h2>COMTE.</h2>

<div class="blkquot"><p><i>Cours de Philosophie Positive</i>, par M. Auguste Comte.</p></div>

<p>It is pleasant to find in some extreme,
uncompromising, eccentric
work, written for the complete renovation
of man, a new establishment of
truth, little else, after all its tempest
of thought has swept over the mind,
than another confirmation of old, and
long-settled, and temperate views.
Our sober philosophy, like some familiar
landscape seen after a thunder
storm, comes out but the more distinct,
the brighter, and the more tranquil,
for the bursting cloud and the
windy tumult that had passed over its
surface. Some such experience have
we just had. Our Conservative principles,
our calm and patient manner
of viewing things, have rarely received
a stronger corroboration than from
the perusal or the extraordinary work
of M. Comte&mdash;a work written, assuredly,
for no such comfortable purpose,
but for the express object (so far as
we can at present state it to our readers)
of re-organizing political society,
by means of an intellectual reformation
amongst political thinkers.</p>

<p>We would not be thought to throw
an idle sneer at those generous hopes
of the future destiny of society which
have animated some of the noblest
and most vigorous minds. It is no
part of a Conservative philosophy to
doubt on the broad question of the
further and continuous improvement
of mankind. Nor will the perusal of
M. Comte's work induce, or permit,
such a doubt. But while he leaves
with his reader a strong impression
of the unceasing development of social
man, he leaves a still stronger impression
of the futile or mischievous efforts
of those&mdash;himself amongst the
number&mdash;who are thrusting themselves
forward as the peculiar and exclusive
advocates of progress and improvement.
He exhibits himself in
the attitude of an innovator, as powerless
in effect as he is daring to design;
whilst, at the same time, he
deals a <i>crashing</i> blow (as upon rival
machinators) on that malignant party
in European politics, whether it call
itself liberal or of the movement,
whose most distinct aim seems to be
to unloose men from the bonds of
civil government. We, too, believe in
the silent, irresistible progress of human
society, but we believe also that
he is best working for posterity, as
well as for the welfare of his contemporaries,
who promotes order and
tranquil effort in his own generation,
by means of those elements of order
which his own generation supplies.</p>

<p>That which distinguishes M. Comte's
work from all other courses of philosophy,
or treatises upon science, is the
attempt to reduce to the <i>scientific method</i>
of cogitation the affairs of human
society&mdash;morality, politics; in short, all
those general topics which occupy our
solitary and perplexed meditation, or
sustain the incessant strife of controversy.
These are to constitute a new
science, to be called <i>Social Physics</i>, or
<i>Sociology</i>. To apply the Baconian,
or, as it is here called, the positive
method, to man in all phases of his
existence&mdash;to introduce the same fixed,
indissoluble, imperturbable order in
our ideas of morals, politics, and history,
that we attain to astronomy and
mechanics, is the bold object of his
labours. He does not here set forth
a model of human society based on
scientific conclusions; something of
this kind is promised us in a future
work; in the present undertaking he
is especially anxious to compel us to
think on all such topics in the scientific
method, <i>and in no other</i>. For be
it known, that science is not only weak
in herself, and has been hitherto incompetent
to the task of unravelling
the complicate proceedings of humanity,
but she has also a great rival in
the form of theologic method, wherein
the mind seeks a solution for its
difficulties in a power above nature.
The human being has contracted an
inveterate habit of viewing itself as
standing in a peculiar relation to a
supreme Architect and Governor of
the world&mdash;a habit which in many
ways, direct and indirect, interferes, it
seems, with the application of the positive
method. This habit is to be
corrected; such supreme Architect
and Governor is to be dismissed from
<a class="pagenum" name="page398" id="page398" title="page398"></a>the imagination of men; science is to
supply the sole mode of thought, and
humanity to be its only object.</p>

<p>We have called M. Comte's an extraordinary
book, and this is an epithet
which our readers are already
fully prepared to apply. But the book,
in our judgment, is extraordinary in
more senses than one. It is as remarkable
for the great mental energy
it displays, for its originality and occasional
profundity of thought, as it
is for the astounding conclusions to
which it would conduct us, for its
bold paradoxes, and for what we can
designate no otherwise than its egregious
errors. As a discipline of the
mind, so far as a full appreciation is
concerned of the scientific method, it
cannot be read without signal advantage.
The book is altogether an anomaly;
exhibiting the strangest mixture
that ever mortal work betrayed
of manifold blunder and great intellectual
power. The man thinks at
times with the strength of a giant.
Neither does he fail, as we have already
gathered, in the rebellious and
destructive propensities for which
giants have been of old renowned.
Fable tells us how they could have
no gods to reign over them, and how
they threatened to drive Jupiter himself
from the skies. Our intellectual
representative of the race nourishes
designs of equal temerity. Like his
earth-born predecessors, his rage, we
may be sure, will be equally vain.
No thunder will be heard, neither will
the hills move to overwhelm him; but
in due course of time he will lie down,
and be covered up with his own earth,
and the heavens will be as bright and
stable as before, and still the abode of
the same unassailable Power.</p>

<p>For the <i>style</i> of M. Comte's work,
it is not commendable. The philosophical
writers of his country are in
general so distinguished for excellence
in this particular, their exposition of
thought is so remarkably felicitous,
that a failure in a Frenchman in the
mere art of writing, appears almost as
great an anomaly as any of the others
which characterize this production.
During the earlier volumes, which are
occupied with a review of the recognized
branches of science, the vices of
style are kept within bounds, but
after he has entered on what is the
great subject of all his lucubrations,
his social physics, they grow distressingly
conspicuous. The work extends
to six volumes, some of them of unusually
large capacity; and by the time
we arrive at the last and the most bulky,
the style, for its languor, its repetitions,
its prolixity, has become intolerable.</p>

<p>Of a work of this description, distinguished
by such bold features, remarkable
for originality and subtlety,
as well as for surprising hardihood
and eccentricity of thought, and bearing
on its surface a manner of exposition
by no means attractive, we imagine
that our readers will not be
indisposed to receive some notice.
Its errors&mdash;supposing we are capable
of coping with them&mdash;are worthy of
refutation. Moreover, as we have
hinted, the impression it conveys is,
in relation to politics, eminently Conservative;
for, besides that he has
exposed, with peculiar vigour, the
utter inadequacy of the movement, or
liberal party, to preside over the organization
of society, there is nothing
more calculated to render us content
with an <i>empirical</i> condition of tolerable
well-being, than the exhibition
(and such, we think, is here presented
to us) of a strong mind palpably at
fault in its attempt to substitute, out
of its own theory of man, a better
foundation for the social structure than
is afforded by the existing unphilosophical
medley of human thought.
Upon that portion of the <i>Cours de
Philosophie Positive</i> which treats of
the sciences usually so called, we do
not intend to enter, nor do the general
remarks we make apply to it. Our
limited object is to place our reader at
the point of view which M. Comte
takes in his new science of Sociology;
and to do this with any justice to him
or to ourselves, in the space we can
allot to the subject, will be a task of
sufficient difficulty.</p>

<p>And first, as to the title of the work,
<i>Philosophie Positive</i>, which has, perhaps,
all this while been perplexing
the reader. The reasons which induced
M. Comte to adopt it, shall be
given in his own words; they could
not have been appreciated until some
general notion had been given of the
object he had in view.</p>

<div class="blkquot"><p>&quot;There is doubtless,&quot; he says, in his
<i>Avertissement</i>, &quot;a close resemblance between
my <i>Philosophie Positive</i>, and what
the English, especially since the days of
Newton, understand by <i>Natural Philosophy</i>.
<a class="pagenum" name="page399" id="page399" title="page399"></a>But I would not adopt this last
expression, any more than that of <i>Philosophy
of the Sciences</i>, which would have
perhaps been still more precise, because
neither of these has yet been extended to
all orders of phenomena, whilst <i>Philosophie
Positive</i>, in which I comprehend the
study of the social phenomena, as well as
all others, designs a uniform manner of
reasoning applicable to all subjects on which
the human mind can be exerted. Besides
which, the expression <i>Natural Philosophy</i>
is employed in England to denote the
aggregate of the several sciences of observation,
considered even in their most
minute details; whereas, by the title of
<i>Philosophie Positive</i>, I intimate, with
regard to the several positive sciences, a
study of them only in their generalities,
conceiving them as submitted to a uniform
method, and forming the different parts of
a general plan of research. The term
which I have been led to construct is,
therefore, at once more extended and more
restricted than other denominations, which
are so far similar that they have reference
to the same fundamental class of ideas.&quot;</p></div>

<p>This very announcement of M.
Comte's intention to comprehend in
his course of natural philosophy the
study of the several phenomena, compels
us to enquire how far these are
fit subjects for the strict application
of the scientific method. We waive
the metaphysical question of the free
agency of man, and the theological
question of the occasional interference
of the Divine Power; and presuming
these to be decided in a manner favourable
to the project of our Sociologist,
we still ask if it be possible to make
of the affairs of society&mdash;legislation
and politics, for instance&mdash;a department
of science?</p>

<p>The mere multiplicity and complication
of facts in this department of
enquiry, have been generally regarded
as rendering such an attempt hopeless.
In any social problem of importance,
we invariably feel that to embrace the
whole of the circumstances, with all
their results and dependencies, is really
out of our power, and we are forced
to content ourselves with a judgment
formed on what appear to us the principal
facts. Thus arise those limited
truths, admitting of exceptions, of
qualification, of partial application, on
which we are fain to rely in the conduct
of human affairs. In framing his
measures, how often is the statesman,
or the jurist, made aware of the utter
impossibility of guarding them against
every species of objection, or of so
constructing them that they shall present
an equal front on every side!
How still more keenly is the speculative
politician made to feel, when giving
in his adherence to some great
line of policy, that he cannot gather
in under his conclusions <i>all</i> the political
truths he is master of! He reluctantly
resigns to his opponent the possession,
or at least the usufruct, of a
certain class of truths which he is
obliged to postpone to others of more
extensive or more urgent application.</p>

<p>But this multiplicity and complication
of facts may merely render the
task of the Sociologist extremely difficult,
not impossible; and the half
truths, and the perplexity of thought
above alluded to, may only prove that
his scientific task has not yet been
accomplished. Nothing is here presented
in the nature of the subject to
exclude the strict application of <i>the
method</i>. There is, however, one essential,
distinctive attribute of human society
which constitutes a difference in
the nature of the subject, so as to
render impossible the same scientific
survey and appreciation of the social
phenomena of the world that we may
expect to obtain of the physical. This
is the gradual and incessant <i>developement</i>
which humanity has displayed,
and is still displaying. Who can tell
us that that <i>experience</i> on which a
fixed and positive theory of social man
is to be formed, is all before us?
From age to age that experience is
enlarging.</p>

<p>In all recognized branches of science
nature remains the same, and continually
repeats herself; she admits of no
novelty; and what appears new to us,
from our late discovery of it, is as old
as the most palpable sequence of
facts that, generation after generation,
catches the eye of childhood.
The new discovery may disturb our
theories, it disturbs not the condition
of things. All is still the same as it
ever was. What we possessed of real
knowledge is real knowledge still. We
sit down before a maze of things bewildering
enough; but the vast mechanism,
notwithstanding all its labyrinthian
movements, is constant to
itself, and presents always the same
problem to the observer. But in this
department of humanity, in this sphere
of social existence, the case is otherwise.
The human being, with hand,
with intellect, is incessantly at work&mdash;has
a progressive movement&mdash;<i>grows</i>
<a class="pagenum" name="page400" id="page400" title="page400"></a>from age to age. He discovers, he
invents, he speculates; his own inventions
react upon the inventor; his own
thoughts, creeds, speculations, become
agents in the scene. Here <i>new facts</i>
are actually from time to time starting
into existence; new elements are introduced
into society, which science
could not have foreseen; for if they
could have been foreseen, they would
already have been there. A new
creed, even a new machine, may confound
the wisest of speculations. Man
is, in relation to the science that would
survey society, a <i>creator</i>. In short,
that stability in the order of events,
that invariable recurrence of the same
linked series, on which science depends
for its very existence, here, in
some measure, fails us. In such degree,
therefore, as humanity can be
described as progressive, or developing
itself, in such degree is it an untractable
subject for the scientific method.
We have but one world, but
one humanity before us, but one specimen
of this self developing creature,
and that perhaps but half grown, but
half developed. How can we know
whereabouts <i>we are</i> in our course, and
what is coming next? We want the
history of some extinguished world in
which a humanity has run its full
career; we need to extend our observation
to other planets peopled with
similar but variously developed inhabitants,
in order scientifically to understand
such a race as ours.</p>

<p>What, for example, could be more
safely stated as an eternal law of society
than that of property?&mdash;a law
which so justly governs all our political
reasonings, and determines the
character of our political measures
the most prospective&mdash;a law which
M. Comte has not failed himself to
designate as fundamental. And yet,
by what right of demonstration can we
pronounce this law to be inherent in
humanity, so that it shall accompany
the race during every stage of its
progress? That industry should be
rewarded by a personal, exclusive
property in the fruits of industry, is
the principle consecrated by our law
of property, and to which the spontaneous
passions of mankind have in
all regions of the earth conducted.
Standing where we do, and looking
out as far as our intellectual vision
can extend, we pronounce it to be the
basis of society; but if we added
that, as long as the world lasts, it
must continue to be the basis of society,
that there are no elements in man to
furnish forth, if circumstances favoured
their development, a quite different
principle for the social organization,
we feel that we should be overstepping
the modest bounds of truth, and
stating our proposition in terms far
wider and more absolute than we
were warranted. Experiments have
been made, and a tendency has repeatedly
been manifested, to frame
an association of men in which the
industry of the individual should have
its immediate reward and motive in
the participated prosperity of the general
body&mdash;where the good of the
whole should be felt as the interest
of each. <i>How</i> such a principle is to
be established, we confess ourselves
utterly at a loss to divine; but that
no future events unforeseen by us,
no unexpected modification of the
circumstances affecting human character,
shall ever develop and establish
such a principle&mdash;this is what
no scientific mind would venture to
assert. Our knowledge is fully commensurate
to our sphere of activity,
nor need it, nor <i>can</i> it, pass beyond
that sphere. We know that the law
of property now forms the basis of
society; we know that an attempt to
abrogate it would be the signal for
war and anarchy, and we know this
also, that <i>at no time</i> can its opposite
principle be established by force, because
its establishment will require a
wondrous harmony in the social
body; and a civil war, let the victory
fall where it may, must leave mankind
full of dissension, rancour, and
revenge. Our convictions, therefore,
for all practical purposes, can receive
no confirmation. If the far future is
to be regulated by different principles,
of what avail the knowledge of
them, or how can they be intelligible
to us, to whom are denied the circumstances
necessary for their establishment,
and for the demonstration of
their reasonableness?</p>

<p>&quot;The great Aristotle himself,&quot;
says M. Comte, speaking of the impossibility
of any man elevating himself
above the circumstances of his
age&mdash;&quot;The great Aristotle himself,
the profoundest thinker of ancient
times, (<i>la plus forte t&ecirc;te de toute l'antiquit&eacute;</i>,)
could not conceive of a state
of society not based on slavery, the
irrevocable abolition of which commenced
a few generations afterwards.&quot;&mdash;Vol.
<a class="pagenum" name="page401" id="page401" title="page401"></a>iv. p.38. In the sociology
of Aristotle, slavery would have
been a fundamental law.</p>

<p>There is another consideration, not
unworthy of being mentioned, which
bears upon this matter. In one portion
of M. Comte's work, (we cannot
now lay our hand upon the passage,)
the question comes before him of the
comparative <i>happiness</i> of the savage
and the civilized man. He will not
entertain it, refuses utterly to take
cognizance of the question, and contents
himself with asserting the fuller
<i>development</i> of his nature displayed
by the civilized man. M. Comte
felt that science had no scale for this
thing happiness. It was not ponderable,
nor measurable, nor was there
an uniformity of testimony to be collected
thereon. How many of our
debates and controversies terminate
in a question of this kind&mdash;of the
comparative happiness of two several
conditions? Such questions are, for
the most part, practically decided by
those who have to <i>feel</i>; but to estimate
happiness by and for the feelings
of others, would be the task of
science. Some future Royal Society
must be called upon to establish a
<i>standard measure</i> for human felicity.</p>

<p>We are speaking, it will be remembered,
of the production of a science.
A scientific discipline of mind is undoubtedly
available in the examination
of social questions, and may be
of eminent utility to the moralist, the
jurist, and the politician&mdash;though it
is worthy of observation that even the
habit of scientific thought, if not in
some measure tempered to the occasion,
may display itself very inconveniently
and prejudicially in the determination
of such questions. Our
author, for instance, after satisfying
himself that marriage is a fundamental
law of society, is incapable of
tolerating any infraction whatever of
this law in the shape of a divorce.
He would give to it the rigidity of
a law of mechanics; he finds there
should be cohesion here, and he will
not listen to a single case of separation:
forgetful that a law of society
may even be the more stable for admitting
exceptions which secure for it
the affection of those by whom it is
to be reverenced and obeyed.</p>

<p>With relation to the <i>past</i>, and in
one point of view&mdash;namely, so far as
regards the development of man in
his speculative career&mdash;our Sociologist
has endeavoured to supply a law
which shall meet the peculiar exigencies
of his case, and enable him to
take a scientific survey of the history
of a changeful and progressive being.
At the threshold of his work we encounter
the announcement of a <i>new
law</i>, which has regulated the development
of the human mind from its
rudest state of intellectual existence.
As this law lies at the basis of M.
Comte's system&mdash;as it is perpetually
referred to throughout his work&mdash;as
it is by this law he proceeds to view
history in a scientific manner&mdash;as,
moreover, it is by aid of this law that
he undertakes to explain the <i>provisional
existence</i> of all theology, explaining
it in the past, and removing it
from the future&mdash;it becomes necessary
to enter into some examination of its
claims, and we must request our readers'
attention to the following statement
of it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blkquot"><p>&quot;In studying the entire development
of the human intelligence in its different
spheres of activity, from its first efforts
the most simple up to our own days, I
believe I have discovered a great fundamental
law, to which it is subjected by an
invariable necessity, and which seems to
me capable of being firmly established,
whether on those proofs which are furnished
by a knowledge of our organization,
or on those historical verifications which
result from an attentive examination of
the past. The law consists in this&mdash;that
each of our principal conceptions, each
branch of our knowledge, passes successively
through three different states of theory:
the <i>theologic</i>, or fictitious; the <i>metaphysic</i>,
or abstract; the scientific, or <i>positive</i>. In
other terms, the human mind, by its nature,
employs successively, in each of its researches,
three methods of philosophizing,
the character of which is essentially different,
and even radically opposed; at first
the theologic method, then the metaphysical,
and last the positive method. Hence
three distinct philosophies, or general
systems of conceptions on the aggregate of
phenomena, which mutually exclude each
other; the first is the necessary starting-point
of the human intelligence; the third
is its fixed and definite state; the second
is destined to serve the purpose only of
transition.</p>

<p>&quot;In the <i>theologic</i> state, the human mind,
directing its researches to the intimate
nature of things, the first causes and the
final causes of all those effects which arrest
its attention, in a word, towards an absolute
knowledge of things, represents to itself
<a class="pagenum" name="page402" id="page402" title="page402"></a>the phenomena as produced by the direct
and continuous action of supernatural
agents, more or less numerous, whose
arbitrary intervention explains all the apparent
anomalies of the universe.</p>

<p>&quot;In the <i>metaphysic</i> state, which is, in
its essence, a modification of the former,
the supernatural agents are displaced by
abstract forces, veritable entities (personified
abstractions) inherent in things, and
conceived as capable of engendering by
themselves all the observed phenomena&mdash;whose
explanation, thenceforth, consists in
assigning to each its corresponding entity.</p>

<p>&quot;At last, in the <i>positive</i> state the human
mind, recognizing the impossibility of
obtaining absolute notions, renounces the
search after the origin and destination of
the universe, and the knowledge of the
intimate causes of phenomena, to attach
itself exclusively to the discovery, by the
combined efforts of ratiocination and observation,
of their effective laws; that is to
say, their invariable relations of succession
and of similitude. The explanation of
things, reduced now to its real terms, becomes
nothing more than the connexion
established between the various individual
phenomena and certain general facts, the
number of which the progress of science
tends continually to diminish.</p>

<p>&quot;The <i>theologic</i> system has reached the
highest state of perfection of which it is
susceptible, when it has substituted the
providential action of one only being for
the capricious agency of the numerous
independent divinities who had previously
been imagined. In like manner, the last
term of the <i>metaphysic</i> system consists in
conceiving, instead of the different special
entities, one great general entity, <i>nature</i>,
considered as the only source of all phenomena.
The perfection of the <i>positive</i>
system, towards which it unceasingly tends,
though it is not probable it can ever attain
to it, would be the ability to represent all
observable phenomena as particular cases
of some one general fact; such, for instance,
as that of gravitation.&quot;&mdash;Vol. I.
p. 5.</p></div>

<p>After some very just, and indeed
admirable, observations on the necessity,
or extreme utility, of a theologic
hypothesis at an early period of mental
development, in order to promote
any systematic thought whatever, he
proceeds thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blkquot"><p>&quot;It is easily conceivable that our understanding,
compelled to proceed by degrees
almost imperceptible, could not pass
abruptly, and without an intermediate
stage, from the <i>theologic</i> to the <i>positive</i>
philosophy. Theology and physics are so
profoundly incompatible, their conceptions
have a character so radically opposed, that
before renouncing the one to employ exclusively
the other, the mind must make
use of intermediate conceptions of a bastard
character, fit, for that very reason, gradually
to operate the transition. Such is
the natural destination of metaphysical
conceptions; they have no other real utility.
By substituting, in the study of phenomena,
for supernatural directive agency
an inseparable entity residing in things,
(although this be conceived at first merely
as an emanation from the former,) man
habituates himself, by degrees, to consider
only the facts themselves, the notion of
these metaphysical agents being gradually
subtilized, till they are no longer in the
eyes of men of intelligence any thing but
the names of abstractions. It is impossible
to conceive by what other process our
understanding could pass from considerations
purely supernatural, to considerations
purely natural, from the theologic to the
positive <i>r&eacute;gime</i>.&quot;&mdash;P. 13.</p></div>

<p>We need hardly say that we enter
our protest against the supposition
that theology is not the <i>last</i>, as well
as the <i>first</i>, of our forms of thought&mdash;against
the assertion that is here, and
throughout the work, made or implied,
that the scientific method, rigidly applied
in its appropriate field of enquiry,
would be found incompatible
with the great argument of an intelligent
Cause, and would throw the
whole subject of theology out of the
range of human knowledge. It would
be superfluous for us to re-state that
argument; and our readers would probably
be more displeased to have presented
before them a hostile view of
this subject, though for the purpose
only of controversy, than they would
be edified by a repetition of those reasonings
which have long since brought
conviction to their minds. We will
content ourselves, therefore, with this
protest, and with adding&mdash;as a fact of
experience, which, in estimating a law
of development, may with peculiar
propriety be insisted on&mdash;that hitherto
no such incompatibility has made
itself evident. Hitherto science, or
the method of thinking, which its
cultivation requires and induces, has
not shown itself hostile to the first
great article of religion&mdash;that on
which revelation proceeds to erect all
the remaining articles of our faith.
If it is a fact that, in rude times, men
began their speculative career by assigning
individual phenomena to the
immediate causation of supernatural
powers, it is equally a fact that they
<a class="pagenum" name="page403" id="page403" title="page403"></a>have hitherto, in the most enlightened
times, terminated their inductive labours
by assigning that <i>unity</i> and
<i>correlation</i> which science points out
in the universe of things to an ordaining
intelligence. We repeat, as a
matter of experience, it is as rare in
this age to find a reflective man who
does not read <i>thought</i> in this unity
and correlation of material phenomena,
as it would have been, in some
rube superstitious period, to discover
an individual who refused to see, in
any one of the specialities around him,
the direct interference of a spirit or
demon. In our own country, men of
science are rather to blame for a too
detailed, a puerile and injudicious, manner
of treating this great argument,
than for any disposition to desert it.</p>

<p>Contenting ourselves with this protest,
we proceed to the consideration
of the <i>new law</i>. That there is, in the
statement here made of the course
pursued in the development of speculative
thought, a measure of truth;
and that, in several subjects, the course
here indicated may be traced, will
probably, by every one who reads the
foregoing extracts, be at once admitted.
But assuredly very few will read
it without a feeling of surprise at finding
what (under certain limitations)
they would have welcomed in the form
of a general observation, proclaimed
to them as a <i>law</i>&mdash;a scientific law&mdash;which
from its nature admits of no
exception; at finding it stated that
every branch of human knowledge
must of necessity pass through these
three theoretic stages. In the case of
some branches of knowledge, it is impossible
to point out what can be understood
as its several theologic and
metaphysic stages; and even in cases
where M. Comte has himself applied
these terms, it is extremely difficult to
assign to them a meaning in accordance
with that which they bear in this
statement of his law; as, for instance,
in his application of them to his own
science of social physics. But we
need not pause on this. What a palpable
fallacy it is to suppose, because
M. Comte find the positive and theologic
methods incompatible, that, historically
speaking, and in the minds of
men, which certainly admit of stranger
commixtures than this, they should
&quot;mutually exclude each other&quot;&mdash;that,
in short, men have not been all along,
in various degrees and proportions,
both <i>theologic</i> and <i>positive</i>.</p>

<p>What is it, we ask, that M. Comte
means by the <i>succession</i> of these several
stages or modes of thinking? Does
he mean that what is here called the
positive method of thought is not
equally <i>spontaneous</i> to the human mind
as the theological, but depends on it
for its development? Hardly so.
The predominance of the positive method,
or its complete formation, may
be postponed; but it clearly has an
origin and an existence independent
of the theological. No barbarian ever
deified, or supernaturalized, every
process around him; there must always
have been a portion of his experience
entertained merely <i>as experience</i>.
The very necessity man has
to labour for his subsistence, brings him
into a practical acquaintance with the
material world, which induces observation,
and conducts towards a natural
philosophy. If he is a theologian the
first moment he gives himself up to
meditation, he is on the road to the
Baconian method the very day he begins
to labour. The rudest workman
uses the lever; the mathematician
follows and calculates the law which
determines the power it bestows;
here we have industry and then science,
but what room for the intervention of
theology?</p>

<p>Or does M. Comte mean this only&mdash;which
we presume to be the case&mdash;that
these methods of thought are, in
succession, predominant and brought
to maturity? If so, what necessity
for this <i>metaphysic</i> apparatus for the
sole purpose of <i>transition</i>? If each
of these great modes, the positive and
theological, has its independent source,
and is equally spontaneous&mdash;if they
have, in fact, been all along contemporary,
though in different stages of
development, the function attributed
to the metaphysic mode is utterly superfluous;
there can be no place for it;
there is no transition for it to operate.
And what can be said of <i>a law
of succession</i> in which there is no relation
of cause and effect, or of invariable
sequence, between the phenomena?</p>

<p>Either way the position of M.
Comte is untenable. If he intends
that his two great modes of thought,
the theologic and the positive, (between
which the metaphysic performs
the function of transition,) are
<i>not</i> equally spontaneous, but that the
one must in the order of nature precede
the other; then, besides that this
is an unfounded supposition, it would
<a class="pagenum" name="page404" id="page404" title="page404"></a>follow&mdash;since the mind, or <i>organization</i>,
of man remains from age to age
the same in its fundamental powers&mdash;that,
at this very time, no man could
be inducted into the positive state of
any branch of knowledge, without
first going through its theologic and
metaphysic. Truth must be expounded
through a course of errors. Science
must be eternally postponed, in every
system of education, to theology, and
a theology of the rudest description&mdash;a
result certainly not contemplated by
M. Comte. If, on the other hand, he
intends that they <i>are</i> equally spontaneous
in their character, equally native
to the mind, then, we repeat,
what becomes of the elaborate and
&quot;indispensable&quot; part ascribed to the
<i>metaphysic</i> of effectuating a transition
between them? And how can we
describe that as a scientific <i>law</i> in
which there is confessedly no immediate
relation of cause and effect, or
sequency, established? The statement,
if true, manifestly requires to
be resolved into the law, or laws, capable
of explaining it.</p>

<p>Perhaps our readers have all this
while suspected that we are acting in
a somewhat captious manner towards
M. Comte; they have, perhaps, concluded
that this author could not have
here required their assent, strictly
speaking, to a <i>law</i>, but that he used
the term vaguely, as many writers
have done&mdash;meaning nothing more
by it than a course of events which
has frequently been observed to take
place; and under this impression they
may be more disposed to receive the
measure of truth contained in it than
to cavil at the form of the statement.
But indeed M. Comte uses the language
of science in no such vague
manner; he requires the same assent
to this law that we give to any one
of the recognized laws of science&mdash;to
that of gravitation for instance,
to which he himself likens it, pronouncing
it, in a subsequent part of
his work, to have been as incontrovertibly
established. Upon this law,
think what we may of it, M. Comte
leans throughout all his progress; he
could not possibly dispense with it;
on its stability depends his whole social
science; by it, as we have already
intimated, he becomes master of the
past and of the future; and an appreciation
of its necessity to him, at once
places us at that point of view from
which M. Comte contemplates our
mundane affairs.</p>

<p>It is his object to put the scientific
method in complete possession of the
whole range of human thought, especially
of the department, hitherto unreduced
to subjection, of social phenomena.
Now there is a great rival in
the field&mdash;theology&mdash;which, besides
imparting its own supernatural tenets,
influences our modes of thinking on
almost all social questions. Theology
cannot itself be converted into a branch
of science; all those tenets by which it
sways the hopes and fears of men are
confessedly above the sphere of science:
if science, therefore, is to rule absolutely,
it must remove theology. But
it can only remove by explaining; by
showing how it came there, and how,
in good time, it is destined to depart.
If the scientific method is entirely to
predominate, it must explain religion,
as it must explain every thing that
exists, or has existed; and it must also
reveal the law of its departure&mdash;otherwise
it cannot remain sole mistress of
the speculative mind. Such is the
office which the law of development
we have just considered is intended to
fulfil; how far it is capable of accomplishing
its purpose we must now leave
our readers to decide.</p>

<p>Having thus, as he presumes, cleared
the ground for the absolute and exclusive
dominion of the positive method,
M. Comte proceeds to erect the <i>hierarchy</i>,
as he very descriptively calls it,
of the several sciences. His classification
of these is based on the simplest
and most intelligible principle.
We think that we rather add to, than
diminish from, the merits of this classification,
when we say, that it is such
as seems spontaneously to arise to any
reflective mind engaged in a review of
human knowledge. Commencing with
the most simple, general, and independent
laws, it proceeds to those
which are more complicated, which
presume the existence of other laws;
in such manner that at every stage of
our scientific progress we are supporting
ourselves on the knowledge acquired
in the one preceding.</p>

<div class="blkquot"><p>&quot;The positive philosophy,&quot; he tells us,
&quot;falls naturally into five divisions, or five
fundamental sciences, whose order of succession
is determined by the necessary or
invariable subordination (estimated according
to no hypothetical opinions) of their several
phenomena; these are, astronomy,
<a class="pagenum" name="page405" id="page405" title="page405"></a>mechanics, (<i>la physique</i>,) chemistry, physiology,
and lastly, social physics. The first
regards the phenomena the most general,
the most abstract, the most remote from
humanity; they influence all others, without
being influenced by them. The phenomena
considered by the last are, on the
contrary, the most complicated, the most
concrete, the most directly interesting to
man; they depend more or less on all the
preceding phenomena, without exercising
on them any influence. Between these
two extremes, the degrees of speciality,
of complication and personality, of phenomena,
gradually increase, as well as their
successive dependence.&quot;&mdash;Vol. I. p. 96.</p></div>

<p>The principle of classification is excellent,
but is there no rank dropt out
of this <i>hierarchy</i>? The metaphysicians,
or psychologists, who are wont
to consider themselves as standing at
the very summit&mdash;where are they?
They are dismissed from their labours&mdash;their
place is occupied by others&mdash;and
what was considered as having
substance and reality in their proceedings,
is transferred to the head of
physiology. The phrenologist is admitted
into the hierarchy of science as
an honest, though hitherto an unpractised,
and not very successful labourer;
the metaphysician, with his class of
internal observations, is entirely scouted.
M. Comte considers the <i>mind</i> as
one of those abstract entities which it
is the first business of the positive
philosophy to discard. He speaks of
man, of his organization, of his thought,
but not, scientifically, of his <i>mind</i>.
This entity, this occult cause, belongs
to the <i>metaphysic</i> stage of theorizing.
&quot;There is no place,&quot; he cries, &quot;for this
illusory psychology, the last transformation
of theology!&quot;&mdash;though, by the
way, so far as a belief in this abstract
entity of mind is concerned, the <i>metaphysic</i>
condition of our knowledge appears
to be quite as old, quite as
primitive, as any conception whatever of
theology. Now, whether M. Comte
be right in this preference of the
phrenologist, we will not stay to discuss&mdash;it
were too wide a question;
but thus much we can briefly and indisputably
show, that he utterly misconceives,
as well as underrates, the
<i>kind of research</i> to which psychologists
are addicted. As M. Comte's style
is here unusually vivacious, we will
quote the whole passage. Are we
uncharitable in supposing that the
prospect of demolishing, at one fell
swoop, the brilliant reputations of a
whole class of Parisian <i>savans</i>, added
something to the piquancy of the
style?</p>

<div class="blkquot"><p>&quot;Such has gradually become, since the
time of Bacon, the preponderance of the
positive philosophy; it has at present assumed
indirectly so great an ascendant
over those minds even which have been
most estranged from it, that metaphysicians
devoted to the study of our intelligence,
can no longer hope to delay the
fall of their pretended science, but by presenting
their doctrines as founded also
upon the observation of facts. For this
purpose they have, in these later times,
attempted to distinguish, by a very singular
subtilty, two sorts of observations of
equal importance, the one external, the
other internal; the last of which is exclusively
destined for the study of intellectual
phenomena. This is not the place to
enter into the special discussion of this
sophism. I will limit myself to indicate
the principal consideration, which clearly
proves that this pretended direct contemplation
of the mind by itself, is a pure
illusion.</p>

<p>&quot;Not a long while ago men imagined
they had explained vision by saying that
the luminous action of bodies produces on
the retina pictures representative of
external forms and colours. To this the
physiologists [query, the <i>physiologists</i>]
have objected, with reason, that if it was
<i>as images</i> that the luminous impressions
acted, there needed another eye within
the eye to behold them. Does not a
similar objection hold good still more
strikingly in the present case?</p>

<p>&quot;It is clear, in fact, from an invincible
necessity, that the human mind can observe
directly all phenomena except its
own. For by whom can the observation
be made? It is conceivable that,
relatively to moral phenomena, man can observe
himself in regard to the passions
which animate him, from this anatomical
reason, that the organs which are the seat
of them are distinct from those destined
to the function of observation. Though
each man has had occasion to make on
himself such observations, yet they can
never have any great scientific importance;
and the best means of knowing the passions
will be always to observe them without;
[<i>indeed</i>!] for every state of passion
very energetic&mdash;that is to say, precisely
those which it would be most essential to
examine, are necessarily incompatible with
the state of observation. But as to observing
in the same manner intellectual
phenomena, while they are proceeding, it
is manifestly impossible. The thinking
individual cannot separate himself in two
parts, of which the one shall reason, and
<a class="pagenum" name="page406" id="page406" title="page406"></a>the other observe it reasoning. The organ
observed and the organ observing being
in this case identical, how can observation
be carried on?</p>

<p>&quot;This pretended psychological method
is thus radically absurd. And only consider
to what procedures profoundly contradictory
it immediately conducts! On
the other hand, they recommend you to
isolate yourself as much as possible from
all external sensation; and, above all,
they interdict you every intellectual exercise;
for if you were merely occupied in
making the most simple calculation, what
would become of your <i>internal</i> observation?
On the other hand, after having
thus, by dint of many precautions, attained
to a perfect state of intellectual slumber,
you are to occupy yourself in contemplating
the operations passing in your mind&mdash;while
there is no longer any thing passing
there. Our descendants will one day see
these ludicrous pretensions transferred to
the stage.&quot;&mdash;P. 34.</p></div>

<p>They seem transferred to the stage
already&mdash;so completely burlesqued is
the whole process on which the psychologist
bases his results. He does not
pretend to observe the mind itself; but
he says, you can remember previous
states of consciousness, whether of
passion or of intellectual effort, and
pay renewed attention to them. And
assuredly there is no difficulty in understanding
this. When, indeed, M.
Cousin, after being much perplexed
with the problem which Kant had
thrown out to him, of objective and
subjective truth, comes back to the
public and tells them, in a second edition
of his work, that he has succeeded
in discovering, in the inmost recesses
of the mind, and at a depth of the
consciousness to which neither he
nor any other had before been able to
penetrate, this very sense of the absolute
in truth of which he was in
search&mdash;something very like the account
which M. Conte gives, may be
applicable. But when M. Cousin, or
other psychologists, in the ordinary
course of their investigations, observe
mental phenomena, they simply pay
attention to what memory brings them
of past experiences; observations
which are not only a legitimate source
of knowledge, but which are continually
made, with more or less accuracy,
by every human being. If they are
impossible according to the doctrines
of phrenology, let phrenology look to
this, and rectify her blunder in the
best way, as speedily as she can. M.
Comte may think fit to depreciate the
labours of the metaphysician; but it
is not to the experimental philosopher
alone that he is indebted for that positive
method which he expounds
with so exclusive an enthusiasm. M.
Comte is a phrenologist; he adopts
the fundamental principles of Gall's
system, but repudiates, as consummately
absurd, the list of organs, and
the minute divisions of the skull,
which at present obtain amongst
phrenologists. How came he, a phrenologist,
so far and no further, but from
certain information gathered from his
consciousness, or his memory, which
convicted phrenology of error? And
how can he, or any other, rectify this
erroneous division of the cranium, and
establish a more reasonable one, unless
by a course of craniological observations
directed and confirmed by
those internal observations which he
is pleased here to deride?</p>

<p>His hierarchy being erected, he
next enters on a review of the several
received sciences, marking throughout
the successful, or erroneous, application
of the positive method. This
occupies three volumes. It is a portion
of the work which we are restricted
from entering on; nor shall we
deviate from the line we have prescribed
to ourselves. But before
opening the fourth volume, in which
he treats of social physics, it will not
be beside our object to take a glance at
the <i>method</i> itself, as applied in the
usual field of scientific investigation,
to nature, as it is called&mdash;to inorganic
matter, to vegetable and animal life.</p>

<p>We are not here determining the
merits of M. Comte in his exposition
of the scientific method; we take it
as we find it; and, in unsophisticated
mood, we glance at the nature of this
mental discipline&mdash;to make room for
which, it will be remembered, so wide
a territory is to be laid waste.</p>

<p>Facts, or phenomena, classed according
to their similitude or the law
of their succession&mdash;such is the material
of science. All enquiry into
causes, into substance, into being,
pronounced impertinent and nugatory;
the very language in which
such enquiries are couched not allowed,
perhaps, to have a meaning&mdash;such
is the supreme dictate of the method,
and all men yield to it at least a nominal
submission. Very different is
the aspect which science presents to
us in these severe generalities, than
<a class="pagenum" name="page407" id="page407" title="page407"></a>when she lectures fluently before gorgeous
orreries; or is heard from behind
a glittering apparatus, electrical
or chemical; or is seen, gay and sportive
as a child, at her endless game of
unwearying experiment. Here she is
the harsh and strict disciplinarian. The
museful, meditative spirit passes from
one object of its wonder to another, and
finds, at every pause it makes, that
science is as strenuous in forbidding
as in satisfying enquiry. The planet
rolls through space&mdash;ask not how!&mdash;the
mathematician will tell you at
what rate it flies&mdash;let his figures suffice.
A thousand subtle combinations
are taking place around you, producing
the most marvellous transformations&mdash;the
chemist has a table of substances,
and a table of proportions&mdash;names
and figures both&mdash;<i>why</i> these
transmutations take place, is a question
you should be ashamed to ask.
Plants spring up from the earth, and
<i>grow</i>, and blossom at your feet, and
you look on with delight, and an unsubduable
wonder, and in a heedless
moment you ask what is <i>life?</i> Science
will generalize the fact to you&mdash;give
you its formula for the expression of
<i>growth, decomposition, and recomposition</i>,
under circumstances not as yet
very accurately collected. Still you
stand gazing at the plant which a short
while since stole through a crevice of
the earth, and taking to itself, with
such subtle power of choice, from the
soil or the air, the matter that it needed,
fashioned it to the green leaf and
the hanging blossom. In vain! Your
scientific monitor calls you from futile
reveries, and repeats his formula of
decomposition and recomposition. As
<i>attraction</i> in the planet is known only
as a movement admitting of a stated
numerical expression, so <i>life</i> in the
plant is to be known only as decomposition
and recomposition taking
place under certain circumstances.
Think of it as such&mdash;no more. But,
O learned philosopher! you exclaim,
you shall tell me that you know not
what manner of thing life is, and I
will believe you; and if you add that
I shall never discover it, I will believe
you; but you cannot prevent me
from knowing that it is something I
do not know. Permit me, for I cannot
help it, still to wonder what life
is. Upon the dial of a watch the
hands are moving, and a child asks
why? Child! I respond, that the
hands <i>do</i> move is an ultimate fact&mdash;so,
represent it to yourself&mdash;and here,
moreover, is the law of their movement&mdash;the
longer index revolves twelve
times while the shorter revolves once.
This is knowledge, and will be of use
to you&mdash;more you cannot understand.
And the child is silent, but still it
keeps its eye upon the dial, and knows
there is something that it does not
know.</p>

<p>But while you are looking, in spite
of your scientific monitor, at this
beautiful creature that grows fixed
and rooted in the earth&mdash;what is this
that glides forth from beneath its
leaves, with self-determined motion,
not to be expressed by a numerical
law, pausing, progressing, seeking,
this way and that, its pasture?&mdash;what
have we here? <i>Irritability and a tissue.</i>
Lo! it shrinks back as the heel of the
philosopher has touched it, coiling and
writhing itself&mdash;what is this? <i>Sensation
and a nerve.</i> Does the nerve <i>feel</i>?
you inconsiderately ask, or is there
some sentient being, other than the
nerve, in which sensation resides? A
smile of derision plays on the lip of the
philosopher. <i>There is sensation</i>&mdash;you
cannot express the fact in simpler or
more general terms. Turn your enquiries,
or your microscope, on the
organization with which it is, in order
of time, connected. Ask not me, in
phrases without meaning, of the unintelligible
mysteries of ontology. And
you, O philosopher! who think and
reason thus, is not the thought within
thee, in every way, a most perplexing
matter? Not more perplexing, he replies,
than the pain of yonder worm,
which seems now to have subsided,
since it glides on with apparent pleasure
over the surface of the earth.
Does the organization of the man, or
something else within him, <i>think</i>?&mdash;does
the organization of that worm, or
something else within it, <i>feel</i>?&mdash;they
are virtually the same questions, and
equally idle. Phenomena are the sole
subjects of science. Like attraction
in the planet, like life in the vegetable,
like sensation in the animal, so thought
in man is an ultimate fact, which we
can merely recognize, and place in its
order in the universe. Come with me
to the dissecting-room, and examine
that cerebral apparatus with which it
is, or <i>was</i>, connected.</p>

<p>All this &quot;craves wary walking.&quot;
It is a trying course, this <i>method</i>, for
the uninitiated. How it strains the
mind by the very limitations it imposes
<a class="pagenum" name="page408" id="page408" title="page408"></a>on its outlook! How mysterious is this
very sharp, and well-defined separation
from all mystery! How giddy is
this path that leads always so close
over the unknowable! Giddy as that
bridge of steel, framed like a scimitar,
and as fine, which the faithful Moslem,
by the aid of his Prophet, will
pass with triumph on his way to Paradise.
But of our bridge, it cannot be
said that it has one foot on earth and
one in heaven. Apparently, it has no
foundation whatever; it rises from
cloud, it is lost in cloud, and it spans
an inpenetrable abyss. A mist, which
no wind disperses, involves both extremities
of our intellectual career,
and we are seen to pass like shadows
across the fantastic, inexplicable interval.</p>

<p>We now open the fourth volume,
which is emblazoned with the title of
<i>Physique Social</i>. And here we will
at once extract a passage, which, if
our own remarks have been hitherto
of an unattractive character, shall reward
the reader for his patience. It
is taken from that portion of the work&mdash;perhaps
the most lucid and powerful
of the whole&mdash;where, in order to
demonstrate the necessity of his new
science of Sociology, M. Comte enters
into a review of the two great political
parties which, with more or less
distinctness, divide every nation of
Europe; his intention being to show
that both of them are equally incompetent
to the task of organizing society.
We shall render our quotation as brief
as the purpose of exposition will allow:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blkquot"><p>&quot;It is impossible to deny that the political
world is intellectually in a deplorable
condition. All our ideas of <i>order</i> are
hitherto solely borrowed from the ancient
system of religious and military power,
regarded especially in its constitution,
catholic and feudal; a doctrine which,
from the philosophic point of view of this
treatise, represents incontestably the <i>theologic</i>
state of the social science. All our
ideas of <i>progress</i> continue to be
exclusively deduced from a philosophy purely
negative, which, issuing from Protestantism,
has taken in the last age its final form
and complete development; the doctrines
of which constitute, in reality, the <i>metaphysic</i>
state of politics. Different classes
of society adopt the one or the other of
these, just as they are disposed to feel
chiefly the want of conservation or that of
amelioration. Rarely, it is true, do these
antagonist doctrines present themselves in
all their plenitude, and with their primitive
homogeneity; they are found less and
less in this form, except in minds purely
speculative. But the monstrous medley
which men attempt in our days of their
incompatible principles, cannot evidently
be endowed with any virtue foreign to the
elements which compose it, and tends
only, in fact, to their mutual neutralization.</p>

<p>&quot;However pernicious may be at present
the theologic doctrine, no true philosophy
can forget that the formation and
first development of modern societies were
accomplished under its benevolent tutelage;
which I hope sufficiently to demonstrate
in the historical portion of this
work. But it is not the less incontestably
true that, for about three centuries, its
influence has been, amongst the nations
most advanced, essentially retrograde, notwithstanding
the partial services it has
throughout that period rendered. It
would be superfluous to enter here into a
special discussion of this doctrine, in order
to show its extreme insufficiency at the
present day. The deplorable absence of
all sound views of social organization can
alone account for the absurd project of
giving, in these times, for the support of
social order, a political system which has
already been found unable to sustain itself
before the spontaneous progress of intelligence
and of society. The historical analysis
which we shall subsequently institute
of the successive changes which have gradually
brought about the entire dissolution
of the catholic and feudal system, will
demonstrate, better than any direct argument,
its radical and irrevocable decay.
The theologic school has generally no other
method of explaining this decomposition
of the old system than by causes merely
accidental or personal, out of all reasonable
proportion with the magnitude of the
results; or else, when hard driven, it has
recourse to its ordinary artifice, and attempts
to explain all by an appeal to the
will of Providence, to whom is ascribed
the intention of raising a time of trial for
the social order, of which the commencement,
the duration, and the character, are
all left equally obscure.&quot;...&mdash;P.14</p>

<p>&quot;In a point of view strictly logical, the
social problem might be stated thus:&mdash;construct
a doctrine that shall be so
rationally conceived that it shall be found,
as it develops itself, to be still always consistent
with its own principles. Neither
of the existing doctrines satisfies this condition,
even by the rudest approximation.
Both display numerous and direct contradictions,
and on important points. By
this alone their utter insufficiency is clearly
exhibited. The doctrine which shall fulfil
this condition, will, from this test, be recognized
as the one capable of reorganizing
<a class="pagenum" name="page409" id="page409" title="page409"></a>society; for it is an <i>intellectual reorganization</i>
that is first wanted&mdash;a re-establishment
of a real and durable harmony
amongst our social ideas, disturbed and
shaken to the very foundation. Should
this regeneration be accomplished in one
intelligence only, (and such must necessarily
be its manner of commencement,)
its extension would be certain; for the
number of intelligences to be convinced
can have no influence except as a question
of time. I shall not fail to point out,
when the proper opportunity arrives, the
eminent superiority, in this respect, of the
positive philosophy, which, once extended
to social phenomena, will necessarily combine
the ideas of men in a strict and
complete manner, which in no other way can
be attained.&quot;&mdash;P. 20.</p></div>

<p>M. Comte then mentions some of
the inconsistencies of the theologic
school.</p>

<div class="blkquot"><p>&quot;Analyze, for example, the vain attempts,
so frequently renewed during two
centuries by so many distinguished minds,
to subordinate, according to the theologic
formula, reason to faith; it is easy to
recognize the radical contradiction this
attempt involves, which establishes reason
herself as supreme judge of this very
submission, the extent and the permanence
of which is to depend upon her variable
and not very rigid decisions. The most
eminent thinker of the present catholic
school, the illustrious <i>De Maistre</i>,
himself affords a proof, as convincing as
involuntary, of this inevitable contradiction
in his philosophy, when, renouncing
all theologic weapons, he labours in his
principal work to re-establish the Papal
supremacy on purely historical and political
reasonings, instead of limiting himself
to command it by right divine&mdash;the
only mode in true harmony with such
a doctrine, and which a mind, at another
epoch, would not certainly have hesitated
to adopt.&quot;&mdash;P. 25.</p></div>

<p>After some further observations on
the theologic or retrograde school, he
turns to the <i>metaphysic</i>, sometimes
called the anarchical, sometimes <i>doctrine
critique</i>, for M. Comte is rich in
names.</p>

<div class="blkquot"><p>&quot;In submitting, in their turn, the <i>metaphysic</i>
doctrine to a like appreciation, it
must never be overlooked that, though
exclusively critical, and therefore purely
revolutionary, it has not the less merited,
for a long time, the title of progressive,
as having in fact presided over the principal
political improvements accomplished
in the course of the three last centuries,
and which have necessarily been of a
<i>negative</i> description. If, when conceived
in an absolute sense, its dogmas manifest,
in fact, a character directly anarchical,
when viewed in an historical position, and
in their antagonism to the ancient system,
they constitute a provisional state, necessary
to the introduction of a new political
organization.</p>

<p>&quot;By a necessity as evident as it is
deplorable, a necessity inherent in our
feeble nature, the transition from one
social system to another can never be
direct and continuous; it supposes always,
during some generations at least, a sort of
interregnum, more or less anarchical,
whose character and duration depend on
the importance and extent of the renovation
to be effected. (While the old system
remains standing, though undermined, the
public reason cannot become familiarized
with a class of ideas entirely opposed to it.)
In this necessity we see the legitimate
source of the present <i>doctrine critique</i>&mdash;a
source which at once explains the indispensable
services it has hitherto rendered,
and also the essential obstacles it now
opposes to the final reorganization of
modern societies....</p>

<p>&quot;Under whatever aspect we regard it,
the general spirit of the metaphysic revolutionary
system consists in erecting into
a normal and permanent state a necessarily
exceptional and transitory condition. By
a direct and total subversion of political
notions, the most fundamental, it represents
government as being, by its nature, the
necessary enemy of society, against which
it sedulously places itself in a constant
state of suspicion and watchfulness; it is
disposed incessantly to restrain more and
more its sphere of activity, in order to
prevent its encroachments, and tends
finally to leave it no other than the simple
functions of general police, without any
essential participation in the supreme direction
of the action of the collective
body or of its social development.</p>

<p>&quot;Approaching to a more detailed examination
of this doctrine, it is evident that
the absolute right of free examination
(which, connected as it is with the liberty
of the press and the freedom of education,
is manifestly its principal and fundamental
dogma) is nothing else, in reality, but the
consecration, under the vicious abstract
form common to all metaphysic conceptions,
of that transitional state of unlimited
liberty in which the human mind has been
spontaneously placed, in consequence of
the irrevocable decay of the theologic
philosophy, and which must naturally remain
till the establishment in the social domain
of the positive method.<a name="footnotetag49" id="footnotetag49"></a><a href="#footnote49"><sup>49</sup></a> ... However
salutary and indispensable in its historical
<a class="pagenum" name="page410" id="page410" title="page410"></a>position, this principle opposes a grave
obstacle to the reorganization of society,
by being erected into an absolute and permanent
dogma. To examine always without
deciding ever, would be deemed great
folly in any individual. How can the dogmatic
consecration of a like disposition
amongst all individuals, constitute the definitive
perfection of the social order, in
regard, too, to ideas whose finity it is so
peculiarly important, and so difficult, to
establish? Is it not evident, on the contrary,
that such a disposition is, from its
nature, radically anarchical, inasmuch as,
if it could be indefinitely prolonged, it
must hinder every true mental organization?</p>

<p>&quot;No association whatever, though destined
for a special and temporary purpose,
and though limited to a small number
of individuals, can subsist without a
certain degree of reciprocal confidence,
both intellectual and moral, between its
members, each one of whom finds a continual
necessity for a crowd of notions, to
the formation of which he must remain a
stranger, and which he cannot admit but
on the faith of others. By what monstrous
exception can this elementary condition
of all society be banished from that
total association of mankind, where the
point of view which the individual takes,
is most widely separated from that point
of view which the collective interest requires,
and where each member is the least
capable, whether by nature or position, to
form a just appreciation of these general
rules, indispensable to the good direction
of his personal activity. Whatever intellectual
development we may suppose possible,
in the mass of men it is evident,
that social order will remain always necessarily
incompatible with the permanent
liberty left to each, to throw back every
day into endless discussion the first principles
even of society....</p>

<p>&quot;The dogma of <i>equality</i> is the most
essential and the most influential after
that which I have just examined, and is,
besides, in necessary relation to the principle
of the unrestricted liberty of judgment;
for this last indirectly leads to the
conclusion of an equality of the most fundamental
character&mdash;an equality of intelligence.
In its bearing on the ancient
system, it has happily promoted the development
of modern civilization, by presiding
over the final dissolution of the old
social classification. But this function
constitutes the sole progressive destination
of this energetic dogma, which tends in its
turn to prevent every just reorganization,
since its destructive activity is blindly directed
against the basis of every new
classification. For, whatever that basis
may be, it cannot be reconciled with a
pretended equality, which, to all intelligent
men, can now only signify the triumph
of the inequalities developed by
modern civilization, over those which had
predominated in the infancy of society....</p>

<p>&quot;The same philosophical appreciation
is applicable with equal ease to the dogma
of the <i>sovereignty of the people</i>. Whilst
estimating, as is fit, the indispensable
transitional office of this revolutionary
dogma, no true philosopher can now misunderstand
the fatal anarchical tendency
of this metaphysical conception, since in
its absolute application it opposes itself to
all regular institution, condemning indefinitely
all superiors to an arbitrary dependence
on the multitude of their inferiors,
by a sort of transference to the people of
the much-reprobated right of kings.&quot;</p></div>

<p>As our author had shown how the
<i>theologic</i> philosophy was inconsistent
often with itself, so, in criticising the
<i>metaphysics</i>, he exposes here also
certain self-contradictions. He reproaches
it with having, in its contests
with the old system, endeavoured,
at each stage, to uphold and adopt
some of the elementary principles of
that very system it was engaged in
destroying.</p>

<div class="blkquot"><p>&quot;Thus,&quot; he says, &quot;there arose a Christianity
more and more simplified, and reduced
at length to a vague and powerless
theism, which, by a strange medley of
terms, the metaphysicians distinguished by
the title of <i>natural religion</i>, as if all religion
was not inevitably <i>supernatural</i>.
In pretending to direct the social reorganization
after this vain conception, the
metaphysic school, notwithstanding its
destination purely revolutionary, has always
implicitly adhered, and does so, especially
and distinctly, at the present day, to
the most fundamental principle of the ancient
political doctrine&mdash;that which represents
the social order as necessarily reposing
on a theological basis. This is now
the most evident, and the most pernicious
inconsistency of the metaphysic doctrine.
Armed with this concession, the school of
Bossuet and De Maistre will always maintain
an incontestable logical superiority over
<a class="pagenum" name="page411" id="page411" title="page411"></a>the irrational detractors of Catholicism,
who, while they proclaim the want of a
religious organization, reject, nevertheless,
the elements indispensable to its realization.
By such a concession the revolutionary
school concur in effect, at the present
day, with the retrograde, in preventing
a right organization of modern societies,
whose intellectual condition more and
more interdicts a system of politics founded
on theology.&quot;</p></div>

<p>Our readers will doubtless agree
with us, that this review of political
parties (though seen through an extract
which we have been compelled
to abbreviate in a manner hardly permissible
in quoting from an author)
displays a singular originality and
power of thought; although each one
of them will certainly have his own
class of objections and exceptions to
make. We said that the impression
created by the work was decidedly
<i>conservative</i>, and this quotation has
already borne us out. For without
implying that we could conscientiously
make use of every argument here put
into our hands, we may be allowed to
say, as the lawyers do in Westminster
Hail, <i>if this be so</i>, then it follows that
we of the retrograde, or as we may
fairly style ourselves in England&mdash;seeing
this country has not progressed
so rapidly as France&mdash;we of the stationary
party are fully justified in
maintaining our position, unsatisfactory
though it may be, till some better
and more definite system has been
revealed to us, than any which has
yet made its advent in the political
world. If the revolutionary, metaphysic,
or liberal school have no proper
office but that of destruction&mdash;if
its nature be essentially transitional&mdash;can
we be called upon to forego this
position, to quit our present anchorage,
until we know whereto we are to
be transferred? Shall we relinquish
the traditions of our monarchy, and
the discipline of our church, before
we hear what we are to receive in exchange?
M. Comte would not advise
so irrational a proceeding.</p>

<p>But M. Comte has himself a <i>constructive</i>
doctrine; M. Comte will
give us in exchange&mdash;what? The
Scientific Method!</p>

<p>We have just seen something of
this scientific method. M. Comte
himself is well aware that it is a style
of thought by no means adapted to the
multitude. Therefore there will arise
with the scientific method an altogether
new class, an intellectual aristocracy,
(not the present race of <i>savans</i>
or their successors, whom he is
particularly anxious to exclude from
all such advancement,) who will expound
to the people the truths to
which that method shall give birth.
This class will take under its control
all that relates to education. It will
be the seat of the moral power, not of
the administrative. This, together
with some arguments to establish
what few are disposed to question, the
fundamental character of the laws of
property and of marriage, is all that
we are here presented with towards
the definite re-organization of society.</p>

<p>We shall not go back to the question,
already touched upon, and which
lies at the basis of all this&mdash;how far it
is possible to construct a science of
Sociology. There is only one way in
which the question can be resolved in
the affirmative&mdash;namely, by constructing
the science.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we may observe, that
the general consent of a cultivated
order of minds to a certain class of
truths, is not sufficient for the purposes
of government. We take, says
M. Comte, our chemistry from the
chemist, our astronomy from the astronomer;
if these were fixed principles,
we should take our politics
with the same ease from the graduated
politician. But it is worth while to
consider what it is we do when we
take our chemistry from the chemist,
and our astronomy from the astronomer.
We assume, on the authority
of our teacher, certain facts which it
is not in our power to verify; but his
reasonings upon these facts we must
be able to comprehend. We follow
him as he explains the facts by which
knowledge has been obtained, and
yield to his statement a rational conviction.
Unless we do this, we cannot
be said to have any knowledge
whatever of the subject&mdash;any chemistry
or astronomy at all. Now, presuming
there were a science of politics,
as fixed and perfect as that of
astronomy, the people must, at all
events, be capable of understanding
its exposition, or they could not possibly
be governed by it. We need
hardly say that those ideas, feelings,
and sentiments, which can be made
general, are those only on which government
can rest.</p>

<p>In the course of the preceding extract,
our author exposes the futility
<a class="pagenum" name="page412" id="page412" title="page412"></a>of that attempt which certain churchmen
are making, as well on this side
of the Channel as the other, to reason
men back into a submission of their
reason. Yet, if the science of Sociology
should be above the apprehension
of the vulgar, (as M. Comte seems
occasionally to presume it would be,)
he would impose on his intellectual
priesthood a task of the very same
kind, and even still more hopeless.
A multitude once taught to argue and
decide on politics, must be reasoned
back into a submission of their reason
to political teachers&mdash;teachers who
have no sacred writings, and no traditions
from which to argue a delegated
authority, but whose authority
must be founded on the very reasonableness
of the entire system of their
doctrine. But this is a difficulty we
are certainly premature in discussing,
as the true Catholic church in politics
has still itself to be formed.</p>

<p>We are afraid, notwithstanding all
his protestations, M. Comte will be
simply classed amongst the <i>Destructives</i>,
so little applicable to the generality
of minds is that mode of thought,
to establish which (and it is for this
we blame him) he calls, and so prematurely,
for so great sacrifices.</p>

<p>The fifth volume&mdash;the most remarkable,
we think, of the whole&mdash;contains
that historical survey which has been
more than once alluded to in the foregoing
extracts. This volume alone
would make the fortune of any expert
Parisian scribe who knew how to select
from its rich store of original materials,
who had skill to arrange and expound,
and, above all, had the dexterity to
adopt somewhat more ingeniously than
M. Comte has done, his abstract statements
to our reminiscences of historical
facts. Full of his own generalities,
he is apt to forget the concrete matter
of the annalist. Indeed, it is a
peculiarity running through the volume,
that generalizations, in themselves
of a valuable character, are
shown to disadvantage by an unskilful
alliance with history.</p>

<p>We will make one quotation from
this portion of the work, and then we
must leave M. Comte. In reviewing
the theological progress of mankind,
he signalizes three epochs, that of
Fetishism, of Polytheism, and of
Monotheism. Our extract shall relate
to the first of these, to that primitive
state of religion, or idolatry, in which
<i>things themselves</i> were worshipped;
the human being transferring to them
immediately a life, or power, somewhat
analogous to its own.</p>

<div class="blkquot"><p>&quot;Exclusively habituated, for so long a
time, to a theology eminently metaphysic,
we must feel at present greatly embarrassed
in our attempt to comprehend this
gross primitive mode of thought. It is
thus that fetishism has often been confounded
with polytheism, when to the
latter has been applied the common expression
of idolatry, which strictly relates
to the former only; since the priests of
Jupiter or Minerva would, no doubt, have
as justly repelled the vulgar reproach of
worshipping images, as do the Catholic
doctors of the present day a like unjust
accusation of the Protestants. But though
we are happily sufficiently remote from
fetishism to find a difficulty in conceiving
it, yet each one of us has but to retrace
his own mental history, to detect the
essential characters of this initial state.
Nay, even eminent thinkers of the present
day, when they allow themselves to be
involuntarily ensnared (under the influence,
but partially rectified, of a vicious
education) to attempt to penetrate the
mystery of the essential production of any
phenomenon whose laws are not familiar
to them, they are in a condition personally
to exemplify this invariable instinctive
tendency to trace the generation of unknown
effects to a cause analogous to life,
which is no other, strictly speaking, than
the principle of fetishism....</p>

<p>&quot;Theologic philosophy, thoroughly investigated,
has always necessarily for its
base pure fetishism, which deifies instantly
each body and each phenomenon capable
of exciting the feeble thought of infant
humanity. Whatever essential transformations
this primitive philosophy may afterwards
undergo, a judicious sociological
analysis will always expose to view this
primordial base, never entirely concealed,
even in a religious state the most remote
from the original point of departure. Not
only, for example, the Egyptian theocracy
has presented, at the time of its greatest
splendour, the established and prolonged
coexistence, in the several castes of the
hierarchy, of one of these religious epochs,
since the inferior ranks still remained in
simple fetishism, whilst the higher orders
were in possession of a very remarkable
polytheism, and the most exalted of its
members had probably raised themselves
to some form of monotheism; but we can
at all times, by a strict scrutiny, detect in
the theologic spirit traces of this original
fetishism. It has even assumed, amongst
subtle intelligences, the most metaphysical
forms. What, in reality, is that celebrated
conception of a soul of the world amongst
the ancients, or that analogy, more modern,
drawn between the earth and an
<a class="pagenum" name="page413" id="page413" title="page413"></a>immense living animal, and other similar
fancies, but pure fetishism disguised in the
pomp of philosophical language? And, in
our own days even, what is this cloudy
pantheism which so many metaphysicians,
especially in Germany, make great boast
of, but generalized and systematized fetishism
enveloped in a learned garb fit to amaze
the vulgar.&quot;&mdash;Vol. V. p. 38.</p></div>

<p>He then remarks on the perfect
adaptation of this primitive theology
to the initial torpor of the human
understanding, which it spares even
the labour of creating and sustaining
the facile fictions of polytheism. The
mind yields passively to that natural
tendency which leads us to transfer to
objects without us, that sentiment of
existence which we feel within, and
which, appearing at first sufficiently to
explain our own personal phenomena,
serves directly as an uniform base, an
absolute unquestioned interpretation,
of all external phenomena. He dwells
with quite a touching satisfaction on
this child-like and contented condition
of the rude intellect.</p>

<div class="blkquot"><p>&quot;All observable bodies,&quot; he says
&quot;being thus immediately personified and
endowed with passions suited to the energy
of the observed phenomena, the external
world presents itself spontaneously to the
spectator in a perfect harmony, such as
never again has been produced, and which
must have excited in him a peculiar sentiment
of plenary satisfaction, hardly by us
in the present day to be characterized,
even when we refer back with a meditation
the most intense on this cradle of
humanity.&quot;</p></div>

<p>Do not even these few fragments
bear out our remarks, both of praise
and censure? We see here traces of
a deep penetration into the nature of
man, coupled with a singular negligence
of the historical picture. The
principle here laid down as that of
fetishism, is important in many respects;
it is strikingly developed, and
admits of wide application; but (presuming
we are at liberty to seek in
the rudest periods for the origin of
religion) we do not find any such
systematic procedure amongst rude
thinkers&mdash;we do not find any condition
of mankind which displays that
complete ascendancy of the principle
here described. Our author would
lead us to suppose, that the deification
of objects was uniformly a species of
explanation of natural phenomena.
The accounts we have of fetishism,
as observed in barbarous countries,
prove to us that this animation of
stocks and stones has frequently no
connexion whatever with a desire to
explain <i>their</i> phenomena, but has resulted
from a fancied relation between
those objects and the human being.
The <i>charm</i> or the <i>amulet</i>&mdash;some object
whose presence has been observed to
cure diseases, or bring good-luck&mdash;grows
up into a god; a strong desire
at once leading the man to pray to his
amulet, and also to attribute to it the
power of granting his prayer.<a name="footnotetag50" id="footnotetag50"></a><a href="#footnote50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>

<p>We carry on our quotation one step
further, for the sake of illustrating the
impracticable <i>unmanageable</i> nature of
our author's generalizations when historically
applied. Having advanced
to this stage in the development of
theologic thought, he finds it extremely
difficult to extricate the human mind
from that state in which he has, with
such scientific precision, fixed it.</p>

<div class="blkquot"><p>&quot;Speculatively regarded, this great
transformation of the religious spirit
<a class="pagenum" name="page414" id="page414" title="page414"></a>(from fetishism to polytheism) is perhaps
the most fundamental that it has ever undergone,
though we are at present so far
separated from it as not to perceive its
extent and difficulty. The human mind,
it seems to me, passed over a less interval
in its transit from polytheism to monotheism,
the more recent and better understood
accomplishment of which has naturally
taught us to exaggerate its importance&mdash;an
importance extremely great only in
a certain social point of view, which I
shall explain in its place. When we reflect
that fetishism supposes matter to be
eminently active, to the point of being
truly alive, while polytheism necessarily
compels it to an inertia almost absolute,
submitted passively to the arbitrary will
of the divine agent; it would seem at first
impossible to comprehend the real mode
of transition from one religious <i>r&eacute;gime</i>
to the other.&quot;&mdash;P. 97.</p></div>

<p>The transition, it seems, was effected
by an early effort of generalization;
for as men recognized the similitude
of certain objects, and classified them
into one species, so they approximated
the corresponding Fetishes, and reduced
them at length to a principal
Fetish, presiding over this class of phenomena,
who thus, liberated from
matter, and having of necessity an independent
being of its own, became a god.</p>

<div class="blkquot"><p>&quot;For the gods differ essentially from
pure fetishes, by a character more general
and more abstract, pertaining to their
indeterminate residence. They, each of
them, administer a special order of phenomena,
and have a department more or
less extensive; while the humble fetish
governs one object only, from which it is
inseparable. Now, in proportion as the
resemblance of certain phenomena was
observed, it was necessary to classify the
corresponding fetishes, and to reduce
them to a chief, who, from this time, was
elevated to the rank of a god&mdash;that is to
say, an ideal agent, habitually invisible,
whose residence is not rigorously fixed.
There could not exist, properly speaking,
a fetish common to several bodies; this
would be a contradiction, every fetish
being necessarily endowed with a material
individuality. When, for example,
the similar vegetation of the several trees
in a forest of oaks, led men to represent,
in their theological conceptions, what was
<i>common</i> in these objects, this abstract being
could no longer be the fetish of a tree, but
became the god of the forest.&quot;&mdash;P. 101.</p></div>

<p>This apparatus of transition is ingenious
enough, but surely it is utterly
uncalled for. The same uncultured
imagination that could animate a tree,
could people the air with gods. Whenever
the cause of any natural event is
<i>invisible</i>, the imagination cannot rest
in Fetishism; it must create some
being to produce it. If thunder is to
be theologically explained&mdash;and there
is no event in nature more likely to
suggest such explanation&mdash;the imagination
cannot animate the thunder;
it must create some being that thunders.
No one, the discipline of whose
mind had not been solely and purely
<i>scientific</i>, would have created for itself
this difficulty, or solved it in such
a manner.<a name="footnotetag51" id="footnotetag51"></a><a href="#footnote51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>

<p>In making so grave a charge, proof will naturally be required of us. Though we
might fill many pages with instances of the two great sins of the translator, commission
and omission, the <i>poco piu</i> and <i>poco meno</i>, we will content ourselves with taking, <i>ad
aperturam libri</i>, an example. At page 55 of the Second Part of Bowring's Russian
Anthology, will be found a short lyric piece of Dm&iacute;trieff, entitled &quot;To Chloe.&quot; It
consists of five stanzas, each of four very short lines. Of these five stanzas, three have
a totally different meaning in the English from their signification in the Russian, and of
the remaining two, one contains an idea which the reader will look for in vain in the
original. This carelessness is the less excusable, as the verses in question present nothing
in style, subject, or diction, which could offer the smallest difficulty to a translator.
Judging this to be no unfair test, (the piece in question was taken at random,)
it will not be necessary to dilate upon minor defects, painfully perceptible through
Bowring's versions; as, for instance, a frequent disregard of the Russian metres&mdash;sins
against <i>costume</i>, as, for example, the making a hussar (a <i>Russian</i> hussar) swear
by his <i>beard</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

best which just now falls under our hand, and perhaps a longer search would not find
a better. Those only who never read <i>The Doctor</i>, will be surprised to find it quoted
on a grave occasion:&mdash;
</p><p>
&quot;The name Fetish, though used by the negroes themselves, is known to be a corrupt
application of the Portuguese word for witchcraft, <i>feiti&ccedil;o</i>; the vernacular name
is <i>Bossum</i>, or <i>Bossifoe</i>. Upon the Gold Coast every nation has its own, every village,
every family, and every individual. A great hill, a rock any way remarkable
for its size or shape, or a large tree, is generally the national Fetish. The king's is
usually the largest tree in his country. They who choose or change one, take the first
thing they happen to see, however worthless&mdash;a stick, a stone, the bone of a beast,
bird, or fish, unless the worshipper takes a fancy for something of better appearance,
and chooses a horn, or the tooth of some large animal. The ceremony of consecration
he performs himself, assembling his family, washing the new object of his devotion,
and sprinkling them with the water. He has thus a household or personal god,
in which he has as much faith as the Papist in his relics, and with as much reason.
Barbot says that some of the Europeans on that coast not only encouraged their slaves
in this superstition, but believed in it, and practised it themselves.&quot;&mdash;Vol. V. p. 136.</p>

<p>At the end of the same chapter from which this extract is taken, the <i>Doctor</i> tells a
story which, if faith could be put in the numerous accounts which men relate of themselves,
(and such, we presume, was the original authority for the anecdote,) might
deserve a place in the history of superstition.

&quot;One of the most distinguished men of the age, who has left a reputation which will be as lasting
as it is great, was, when a boy, in constant fear of a very able but unmerciful schoolmaster;
and in the state of mind which that constant fear produced, he fixed upon a great spider for his
fetish, and used every day to pray to it that he might not be flogged.&quot;</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
